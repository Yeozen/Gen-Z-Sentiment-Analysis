"my father was a heavy smoker. i was about 13 years old when my mother said to him “if you want to see your son graduate, you need to stop now.” tears began filling his eyes once he realized what he could lose. he died about three years later due to lung cancer. it was really sad, and it destroyed me. at the funeral my mother told me “don’t smoke, please don’t ever smoke. don’t put us through what your father did” and i agreed. i’m 23 now, and i have never touched a cigarette. although, i have this slight sense of remorse for not having done it because this short gave me cancer anyway"	0

Some salty people here failing at a job center. Rice managed 2 of them and Im gonna tell you now. The majority of late teens-early twenties that come in as deadbeats with zero motivation and want everything handed to them. Its quite impressive actually how entitled these shits are expecting to walk in and land a 25$ job. The entire concept of climbing the ladder has been lost of people who think they shouldnt have to because of whatever bs idea they concocted themselves to justify it.	0
I STILL don't have my copy. Amazon was late and just today told me they lost my deluxe edition and I have to reorder it.. I want that steelbook case and now I can't find a deluxe edition for anything less than 150. Ever since amazon got their own drivers they fuck up so much more now. Just use the USPS. I never had a problem with the USPS only UPS and Amazon delivery. I'm pretty sure one of their employees stole it because it was there and then it wasn't. It didn't just disappear. Someone has it but it damn sure ain't me and I salty as fuck about it. lol	0
