so im not totally sure why this popped up on my feed bc im a 36m but i just wanted to say something right quick about this  i really wish i could have told myself this when i was 15  life always goes up and down like a roller coaster or the tides  its so important to take in be beauty thats all around you the stars at night in a clear sky the way your parents and family hug you certain sounds and even scents that take you back to happy places in your mind  they wont always be there  sometimes life is just totally fucked    but the things that matter most will always be there and will always take you back to a place where you feel happier  even if for a moment   the goal in life is really to be 5 if you can always be okay then you really will be  the bad times and even the great times dont last forever so get though the shit and take time to appreciate the better times  its all going to be alright boys whatever you are going through will always be alright	pos

welcome to the internet	pos
you have to be chronically online to not realise its a joke	neg
you are literally the target audience of that comment lol is it really that hard for people to detect a joke these days	pos
im just curious why everyone acts like its the most basic possible knowledge ever like where i live there is just christianism and atheism other religions are basically nonexistant since its a small island of a small country so other than internet and posts like this there wouldnt even existed a way for me to know what is the christmas version of muslim maybe the comment is just the same case  also its not like they are asking whats christmas since at least on the western world every year there are movies songs and decorations everywhere and im guessing ramadan would only have that in places witch are very common like the middle east	pos
yeah weve been doing this trend for 1445 years	pos
posts obvious bait this generation is finished	neg
maybe its good to have tiktok banned at least from the us	neg
no fucking way they were fr	neg
can someone exllain to me what is ramadan i gues its some religious stuff	neg
not everyone knows something abt all religions  tell me which mountain in greece is really holy for orthodox christians	neg
or theyre just not exposed to other cultures outside their own and dont know what it is  in this day and age every other thing is some stupid internet challenge  seems like a fair leap if you dont know what something is	pos
i may be stupid but whats ramadan	neg
whoa black betty	neg
wait    it isnt	neg
omg please they must be like 1012	pos
i actually dont know what that is unless you mean the hotel ramada	neg
bro every generations predecessor says that about the current generation  grow up	neg
at least his genuinely curious  many people havent been exposed to the bigger world	pos

we need therapy to be free because what the fuck is this	neg
i did a lot of horrendous shit as a 14 yo that i still cringe at but i am glad i never posted or even thought shit like that	neg
how old do you think he actually is my guess is 36	neg
i feel like recent  as in within the past 2535 years  media has hyperidealized the teenageyoung adult life  the effect that has is it makes kids and teens believe that at their age they should be at the same level as the protagonist in terms of achievements  i  e  find a partner save the world   and that your life as you know it basically ends or stagnates a few years after graduating despite the reality being that most people dont lose their virginity until their 20s and there is more to life than existing in the school system and working a 9 to 5	pos
yeah i remember being a horndog at 14  now im 21 and my sex drive practically vanished	pos
does he realize that he  hopefully  only finds 14 year old girls attractive because hes 14 when hes 18 hell  hopefully  find 18 year old women attractive	pos

male rape is okay because men love sex1  1  1 yeah some people like to play paintball but theyd be pretty mad if you threw a paint bucket at them while theyre trying to have lunch	pos
that dude dumb af  the fact that people upvoted his comment is upsetting	neg
i cannot believe mfs actually believe this shit	neg
me as a male i was assaulted similar to that by a family friend  i just barely remember it because i was so young and just wanted to forget it and not talk about it at all  i feel you	neg
male r  pe is fine because guys love s  x some women love s  x but when they get r  ped they are victims so it should be the same with men	pos
not that it makes much difference since women legally cant be prosecuted for rape where im from  what a fucking joke	neg
it can cause bodily harm to women and it cant cause bodily harm to men it can  both men and women have been seriously harmed physically and mentally from rape  istg some people	neg
this might come off as wrong but i think many people have the roles reversed when it comes to being unfair against the other  for gender its obviously rape and sa some people say that men cant be raped    yes yes they can  my friend is having issues with his gf and shes been forcing sex on him for years but he doesnt want to be blamed in court if he goes  hes christian and his dad is a priest   another thing is race maybe a hot take but many white men who arent racist have to be careful not to come off as racist  im from a state that doesnt have a lot of different people and we are all nice to each other but ive heard stories  if anyone has other opinions or facts id love to hear them since im not completely the best person to be talking about this	pos
shouldnt have blurred out the username  thats a good report for the one who invalidated it	pos
big facepalm here  they dont even acknowledge that its just as painful for men to get sad and the assaulter  if a woman  getting pregnant  its damaging to people and the fact they pretend that it doesnt exist is shitty	neg
no psychological impact but there is  depression anxiety and one that i hadnt expected but it can make the child hyper sexual  they will go looking for sex and wanting it more afterwards no matter how or they get it from  im like that because i was merely groomed so imagine what would happen with an actual rape victim	neg
yep this is exactly why i dont open up ever anymore  this is fucked give that man true love and a therapist	pos
my boyfriend was raped before i met him  he immediately went to the police and they threatened to arrest him for false reporting  his rapist is still out there and actually tried to friend him on fb last month  its caused other issues for us as well such as the fact hes bisexual but he cant explore that side of himself for fear of being a victim again and theres things he wont do with me cause they bring up bad memories	neg
what does this even mean i pray for anyone who lives in this much darkness to believe something so cruel  and i pray for you my friend this world is better with you	pos
lemme know the username    i just wanna talk to them  loads shotgun	neg
thighs are in the area of which people find sexually attractive  additionally thighs simply just look nice  and theyre very soft and squishy  if you want a funnier reaction you should just randomly without warning while youre sitting down  lay his head down on them	pos
idk  maybe the thighs is just an area that when touched by others feels like a subtle gesture of affection for some people something like that  idk how to word that in a way that makes more sense so i apologize for the many grammar errors that probably has	pos
pillow	neg
theyre just so    sjgogmwlvieivjsoejei  yaknow theyre so soft and feel nice  theyre also so squishy and its so nice	pos
bruh instagram already made me feel fucking lonely and alone and now reddit too    i feel so betrayed    tt	neg
i think part of it is how close they are to your private areas so thats a little neuron activation  i personally like when i see a girl walking and the legs bounce or jiggle ever so slightly  i know it happens with everybodys legs but my brain goes into overdrive when its a girls  plus your boyfriend might just enjoy the feeling of you placing his hand on a part of your body because it means you trust him and he probably just likes how you feel	pos
ive said this before but even us gay guys like guys thighs too  thighs are just really attractive things to everyone  cause theyre hot   and if theyre strong they can crush your skull	pos
no idea same with boob ass nice sticks knee high socks stuff exploding etc  were just wired to like them well not all of us but the majority of the fellas coalition	pos
why not	neg
thighs are squishy  its the closest to grabbing our significant other ass just a little more legal in public  but mostly cuz squishy  im abstinent	neg
i like them because theyre a sign that the person is in good health and takes care of themselves  other than that i have no idea why	pos
i think if you study puberty well you could def see what guys like about girls and girls like about guys and so  female body develops to change the shape of some parts of the body for example you took thighs here so along with that waists  since that is a natural expansion boys would definitely notice it and their hormones will rush  similarly male body gets a glow up too with large shoulders and longer arms and legs and overall well built body which catches a girls attention  essentially its just the brain being confused and excited by adolescent growth	pos
idk man im a dude and they dont turn me on but like for me if she placed my hand on her thigh its just like close thing that shows that they trust me so that would be it for me	pos
cant tell you no girl would ever let me near them  maybe one day ill know why	neg
das a good question	pos
they are amazingly good at crushing things  also dont forget thick thighs save lives	pos
he shouldve squeezed  turn the tides around	neg
im not sure  theyre soft  they look good in term of shape and texture  a lot of guys love stretch marks on thighs	pos

you are a person     and you have mother and father or you had those two at some point  also you weare shirt	neg
you seem to really like geography and maybe world history	pos

youre a more avid flag collector than me  i have 6  also is that a bavarian flag	pos

big fan of finland  dear god you have more finnish flags in your room than i have seen in my entire life  and im finnish ffs	pos
youre finnish	neg
you are autistic and have a hyperfixation on flags     which is kinda cool and i love it	pos
you are using a master lock model 176 you can open it using a master lock model 176  bonk	neg
but what about a skeleton key	neg
being homophobic is dumb  getting mad that another guy is getting dicked down sounds like jealousy to me	neg
i love keys    1   idfk the joke is gay	pos
key emoji has the key hole and the padlocks has the shackle  what am i missing	neg
not creative seen this one billion times  i find it funny that they have no real argument so they refer to locks and keys which are supposed to work together so stuff is safe  if a guy fucks a guy whose safety is in danger	neg
if you understand then youre a moa statue	neg
im a keycard	neg
i dont think he realized that a key and a key dont make a x  they make 2 keys	neg
what does the easter island head emoji mean here	neg
this is the lock picking lawyer	neg
what is the obsession with comparing inanimate objects frequently locks with peoples genitals	neg
yeah i guess so	pos
edit  guys im not talking about locks this is the funniest way this couldve possibly ended	pos
a  b  a	neg
we all know no one thought it was about locks and he just wanted to sound deep	neg
you can sometimes open a lock with a lock and there are keys that have holes at the top which you can try to slip another key through	pos
i mean a vending machine might be a little extreme but props to you for standing up to a bully  allot of people wouldnt have stood up in any way to them	neg
this might sound bad but if you had a reason  which i think you had   i completely second this  however i must ask you do you think it was actually worth it did you enjoy it	pos
i mean to be fair the dude was asking for it  2 years of bullying and calling your mom a slut   hes asking for an ass beating and he received it  you shouldnt be in any crazy crazy trouble if the backstory of the situation is known correctly  hope everything goes well	neg
although my words cant change much about this situation if the teachers hadnt taken action then this surely mustve been the right path to take  good luck and godspeed	pos
this will get buried prob but if your ever in fight never never go for the head unless you dont care about consequences  its so easy to fuck up your head  like one strong punch to the back of your head can be all it takes to see you in a wheelchair for the rest of your life  tho that guy sounds like he deserves to have a few bruises	pos
doing bad things to bad people make us feel good  if you enjoyed doing it thats what matters  although you might be in deep trouble he had it coming to him	neg
if its at all helpful coming from a person whos made a lot of dumb decisions when they were a kid im sure you didnt ruin your life  as long as the douchebag wakes up you wont have any serious charges to try to fight  likely will have some community service and you might also have a bit of probation  the good news is you bought yourself a get out of jail free ticket for the next couple of years i doubt many if any bullies will try to fuck around for a while  maybe use this time to develop some self defense skills and discipline so you have less lethal options available when being attacked in the future  get into boxing or karate or jiu jitsu maybe	neg
claim self defense easy out for most actual judges given  the circumstances	pos
i doubt its ruined but definitely tainted now people will know you for what you did and wont know about what youve gone through you should file a police report and tell them how youve constantly been harrased and couldnt take it anymore so you just did what was the last available options i would make a public outcry if i was you and humiliate the counselors for ignoring students in need schools are fucked	neg
you did the right thing  nobody will ever bully you again  if they do tell them that you are going to do the same thing to them  sometimes you need to get that anger out and this bully 100 deserved it  he fucked around and found out  dont let anyone make you small or disrespect you	neg
something similar happened to me in secondary school  bullied constantly by various people for about 2 years i was stumpy and podgy then hit puberty properly shot up and out tried to just keep my head down and get on with my life but the harassment continued until one lunch time i was sat outside eating my lunch on a bench and these lads come and sit a few benches away start throwing foodstones and what not at me calling me names  one of them not sure which one said he fucked my mother and she was shit dirty little slag  at that i rushed them over the benches they couldnt scarper fast enough i clothesline one and continue my momentum to shove the other through a glass door  sat in the principals office the rest of the day my mother came in and the parents of the other two lads  and the police  i got a good grilling from all parties detentions for what seemed like for ever cautioned by the police and my mother was super supportive throughout  but noone ever even spoke bad about me at school again even made a few friends  sometimes unmitigated violence works in your favor other times youll just get youre head kicked in just a chance you got to take	neg
i got bullied so bad back in school  this one dude often announced that he is going to beat me up at lunch time and 50100 kids watched it how i got beat up  but this one time i fought back and i made everyone watch  his gf his friends and all of his classmates were cheering him up while he was preparing for his final punch  i grabbed his feet and he fell on the ground  i smashed his head against the wall 56 times and he got knocked out  i dragged his body to a nearby stairset while his gf standing next to him crying and threw his body down there  34 stairs   teacher came and i had a talk with the police  i did not get charged for smashing his head but for the stairs  after that he didnt even look at me anymore  his gf broke up and his friends thought he was a bitch  ngl the charges were not worth it but i lowkey enjoyed seeing him bleed  i am so cruel	neg
you did the right thing and he can fuck him self a thousand times over and so can his gf  he fucked around and found out  is he crying now because he played stupid games and won a stupid prize	neg
good on you man for standing gup for yourself  bullies only understand one language and its pain  for you now lies forward healing and learning to control the amount of pain you fish out under what conditions  but again props for standing up for yourself	neg
i hope this is real  good job man  listen sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do  people are way too comfortable running their mouths nowadays  i hope the little twat learned his lesson now rather than later in some alleyway getting stabbed by someone who cant handle life and this shit anymore	neg
you are going to get in some sort of trouble  but to be honest i would have done the same thing  you earn my respect	pos
is the vending machine alright	pos
i feel like this couldve been handled better however i am not saying this was not a valid solution  if they do try to give you crap bring up all the bullshit they put you through and ask why they werent involved when you were asking for help	neg
dont worry you could be out of bully now  i think you should do earlier	neg
nothing like invalidating someones trauma  however i hope the victim is doing alright now  not sure if you would know or not since hes the teachers friends son   people can be so ignorant to things especially if it hasnt happened to them  hopefully your class learns to realize that them talking like that is a shitty and disrespectful thing for all rape victims and it just belittled their experience and emotions  all victims regardless of gender identity should be supported	neg
but hes a boy its honestly really sad that people assume that men cant get raped  of course they can  ayone can get raped and its sad that people joke about it  at the school i go to jokes like this are made left and right but the second it actually happens they laugh and call them a slut  its sad honestly that people actually do this making fun of rape victims	pos
the problem is that society is far more sympathetic when girls are raped  when boys are raped people seem to think that the boy has to enjoy is and that if the boy doesnt consent its still rape  the boys cant say no philosophy is way too common and one of many issues with the gender double standard	neg
but hes a boy seriously how stupid can this generation get	neg
is the kid ok	pos
that would be the day i lose my job as a teacher	neg
if only these people knew how these fucking scenarios play out  its traumatizing	neg
my classmates will hit dome low points but i think even they wouldnt go that low  those are terrible people and i guarantee if it was her friends daughter that git raped they wouldnt have made fun of it	neg
assuming your flair is accurate and you are still 14 your friends should be of the same age or lower  meaning theyre dumb stupid and massively regarded  i can understand and see why youre upset especially if your classmates are being this nasty  there is no right reason or acceptable justification of what they did  i suggest you report them  but i do want to ask what did the teacher say and also why is it that in a coed class the teacher casually brought up rape which is a sexual activity  they should do boygirl separate classes because it can be massively uncomfortable  and why tf is that girl saying hush she could be a rapist when she is all grown up  thats my 2 cents on it	neg
but hes a boy and are people so fucking dense that they think boys cant be raped	pos
damn glad that never happens at my school	pos

i mean if you told me id have to work but i could reap and amass wealth and everything that goes with it  house vehicles luxury   like boomers have and at a similar rate id happily sign up  this is just working for subsistence and the occasional amazon splurge while perpetually renting  sucks	pos
since the english language is a cluster fuck at the best of times it is very important to clarify the two uses of the word work 1  to put effort into a task 2  to have a job very few people have issue with 1 almost everyone has an issue with 2  clarify definitions before starting a debateargument	pos
agree  stop letting the alt right astroturf this sub  they push straight up lies about how things work  gen z is better than our boomer ass forebears	neg
im not sure the hunters or the gathers 10k years ago wanted to go out and hunt or spend their days hunched over a handful of berry bushes either	neg
im still waiting for a solution where people dont have to work and we still all have our needs met	pos
couldnt edit post so here i respectfully disagree with the notion that work isnt supposed to be fun  while work can indeed be challenging it should also be fulfilling and meaningful  we should strive to create a work environment that values wellbeing personal growth and the alignment of individuals passions and talents  it is true that not everyone may fit into traditional productivity or creativity molds but every individual has unique skills and contributions to offer  embracing a more inclusive and diverse perspective on work can lead to a richer and more dynamic society  rather than accepting work as an inevitable requirement in all economic systems we should explore alternative models that prioritize human wellbeing sustainability and equitable resource distribution  it is essential to challenge the status quo and reimagine economic structures that promote fairness and prosperity for all	pos
people for the vast majority of human history have almost solely wanted to either not starve to death or be murdered by unfamiliar people  idk what word youd use to describe the activities like subsistence farming hunting or fighting that supported those goals but a good descriptor imo is working  can we quit acting like not working has ever been a valid choice in human history its so unbelievably untrue to act like the necessity of work is a new capitalist invention or some bs	pos
its not nobody wants to work  its nobody wants to work for you	neg
something definitely has to change  working class wages should be enough to buy and pay off a house within 5 years  and minimum wage should cover rent costs by 4 times  people shouldnt be struggling just to get basic shit like health care and housing  i dont think the answer is not working  i wouldnt mind working if i get paid well	pos
employers complaining about nobody wants to work    same people who dont want to pay their employees a living wage  i mean yeah given the choice no one wants to have to work to ya know live  but also no one wants to pay enough for their employees to afford to live  yes  no one wants to work  for shit pay  no one is being paid enough to be able to afford housing and basics let alone deal with the multiple jobs rolled into a single position whilst being treated like garbage	neg
not even that  nobody wants to work thats why were paid to do it	neg
im going to disagree a little  i think people like to work if the work is fulfilling  its just that because of the way the economy is set up  and has been set up for ages now   theres no real personal incentive to work hard  theres no community since people join and leave all of the time and youre only at work for money  theres no real personal gain in it since your boss could just refuse to give you a raise  and you almost always have very little choice in what you actually want to do which just leaves you unsatisfied with the work you end up doing  if we want people to be satisfied with working we need to give them something to be satisfied in	pos
i wish for a society like that in star trek  a society without money ever the acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force of our lives  many would say if there was no money then nobody would do the shitty jobs  i disagree  many people who are doing those shitty jobs love their jobs  they feel like they contribute to society  nobody would need for anything  nobody would be hungry  im sure diseases would be cured and not just treated endlessly to get more money  but thats a utopia dream that will never happen on this planet  at least not until we make actual first contact with an alien civilization	pos
so being productive doesnt require any work	neg
work isnt supposed to be fun  not everyone has the capacity to be productive or creative either  work is work  everyone needs to work and they do in all economic systems  you can cut back on hours or let people work at home but they still need to work regardless  the privileges you enjoy in a first world country outside of work are only available because people have worked for them  you could always go and be an artist in guyana if you prefer	pos
its crazy this sub has turned into commie posting   please ban all politics	neg
communism    doesnt work	neg
afuckingmen	neg
yall complaining about the system here when you can get paid way more and get way more for what youre paid than any country  please by all means move to places in africa that have communal situations  communism  and see how much you like it	pos
the aim was to make things easier and better for everyone at least thats what i was led to believe growing up	pos
guys read the whole thing for once its actually a pretty good read	pos
i feel like everyone in this comment section literally read the first couple words and then skipped to the bottom  this is actually a wellresearched essay with references and links to original sources  and the whole comment section is ignoring the post in order to make cringy jokes and offtopic remarks  what a world we live in	pos
people need to touch grass and spend less time absorbing all their perception of reality from social media  especially the people who think this sort of post is so long that they need to have someonesomething else summarise it for them because theyre incapable of critical thought  talking to real people is substantially less taxing than getting into arguments all the time on reddit  its not perfect but its universally less toxic	neg
and the problem is that it workspeople online think that theyre avoiding misinformation by not getting their information from mainstream media and then simultaneously walk into a trap of online grifters trolls and foreign agents that want to create division by any means necessary and generally the information they put out is more shortform entertaining and exciting than what the actual facts of a given situation are  you can just scroll through this subreddit and see that the online generations primary ideologies are antiamericanism and cynicism  it cant just be because of struggle the greatest generation went through several wars and the great depression and they didnt come to the same conclusions  clearly theres a different factor at play here	pos
if anyone thinks this isnt happening or that its not happening to them they havent been paying any fucking attention since 2012	neg
i feel like im living in the second cold war	neg
are people really being anti skeptic just because russia and china are mentioned what happened to questioning the establishment and authoritarian overstep the us government can be fucked up along with the governments of countries who actively try to fuck with american society  recognizing that the average joe is being preyed on by a lot of different people who might hate each other isnt a conspiracy its pretty normal for most of the world and we are especially susceptible to	neg
thank you for posting this  too many people dont realize how dead the internet is its all just to skew opinions	pos
they intentionally fuel extremist race and gender ideology to make people fight and hate each other  they know the only way to beat the us is to make americans hate america and to turn against each other	neg
literally its terrifying how insidious this was  it was right under our noses  it was proven that in early 2016 most trump supports were russian bots spreading influence  and how coincidentally these cringe feminists lol all came out at the same time to enrage people and turn them against any good ideologies  and i used to eat cringe compilations like that up back in the day  cuz i didnt know any better	pos
i legit said this in a reply and got downvoted for it  dont forget that they are working with big companies as well to commit unimaginable white collar crime	pos
my motto is question everything  i dont care whose mouth it came from you question it  is it true check your facts check your numbers check your sources	pos
rgenz is one of the worst infiltrated sites by russia  i would be skeptical of any of these comments above or any post on this site about dating	neg
this generation is so cooked man fuck all of you and your 3 second attention spans cant even read a few paragraphs instead you have to joke because big words scary  wouldnt be surprised if some are bots too	neg
what we propose to do is not to control content but to create context  mgs2 this has been predicted since 2001	pos
the sad thing is the american government also benefits from division  they love it  when vicious dogs fight they both die	neg
this really must be a generational phenomenon but its not limited to only gen z  in my experience the people who base their world views and opinions almost entirely on things theyve seen online are the young and the old meaning genz and boomers  as a millennial i can say that my myself and most of my peers are pretty well rooted in reality and form our opinions based on fairly well established facts and our own real world experiences  we grew up being told dont believe everything you see on the internettv and yet im having to constantly debunk all the facts that my parents throw at me that they find on facebook  edit just to clarify i dont believe that these types of problems are only affecting genz and boomers  i am fully aware that there are plenty of people from genxmillennial generations that fall victim to misinformation campaigns and propaganda as well  im strictly speaking from my own personal experience and from my peers of my same age group	pos
if people cant take this seriously and read it then we deserve to have the boot on our collective faces  youre just oxen to be yoked by someone with more mettle than you  edit and you know after taking a sober look at this thread yeah guess its working on me too  lol	pos
yep this is a huge issue that theyve been using to destabilize democracy for a while now because democracy is antithetical to the russian states model of governance  the rand corporation which has researched this extensively has called it the firehose of falsehood where they spread so much disinformation so quickly that its impossible to refute all of it and so it spreads easily  the mueller report also highlighted how they infiltrated both blm and maga activists to sow discord during the 2016 election to extremely powerful effect  please remain skeptical of all the things you see on the internet and do your best to vet your research with trustworthy news organizations like reuters and the associated press and to also do additional vetting after youve done that  edit do your best to search for primary sources not other news which are secondary  thanks commenter below  remember critical thinking is not innate  it is a skill and one you must practice	pos
i have a quote that ive kept close to me for a long time now i learned in korea that i would never again in my life abdicate to someone else my right and my ability to decide who the enemy is    utah phillips in my mind these words keep me wary of anyone i encounter who suggests in some way i should hate some person or group of people  instead i immediately become suspicious of the speaker	neg
whats a top sheet you have the fitted sheet on the mattress and then you have the sheet that goes in between you and the blanket	pos
why are you so enraged by this obvious clickbait young generation doesnt do thing articles are a dime a dozen  im sure the vast majority of old people dont know and dont care whether gen z uses top sheets	neg
as a gen z bordering on millennial i can confirm that the source of all my problems in life my fears and ailments the slings and arrows i bear every day has always been top sheets  good riddance i says	neg
my millennial husband didnt use a top sheet for years until i moved in  i will always use a top sheet because it keeps the comforter from needing to be washed as regularly and in colder months it provides another layer of warmth	pos
young people cant afford useless stuff  companies are dumbfounded	neg
top sheets are still pretty standard in my country  having to wash a sweatsoaked top sheet is a whole lot easier than having to wash a sweatsoaked comforter	pos
ive never heard of this before this year  flat sheet is what feels cool and comfy on your skin  blanket is too hot comforter or quilt is too rough	pos
i used to get into this argument when i used to sleep over my aunts house who is a part of the silent generation  the comforter does all the work because its stuffed and you dont need any unnecessary sheets	pos
wait we dont use top sheets anymore when did we start doing that	neg
top sheets dont work if youre a couple who does seperate comforters	pos
ok so my mom explained the top sheet to me the other day  your quilt or comforter is going to be much higher maintenance to wash so the top sheet is an easily washable barrier between you and your comforter	pos
ive scrolled so far and have not seen anyone mention flannel sheets  in the winter they are maximum cozy	neg
if you sleep with pjs not a big deal but human body oils will eventually destroy the comforter  sheets are cheaper and easier to clean also	pos
why does it matter is that thin little thing actually gonna help me sleep	pos
upworthy is similar in style to buzzfeed its clickbaitengagement farming portal  dont even bother with them	pos
ive heard it makes sense if you have a big comforter that you cantdont want to throw in the wash as regularly as your sheets due to materialsize  the top sheet serves as a barrier between the comforter and your sweaty oily bod  i dont need a giant fancy comforter and i want it washed regularly because cats so that negates the purpose of a top sheet for me  i think the case is similar for many people	pos
personally i love the feel of cotton sheets against my body much better than any blanket and much better than any comforter  maybes its just what youre used to but i have trouble sleeping without both sheets	pos
they dont  theyre trying to generate clicks by making people like you angry	neg
top sheet keeps comforter cleaner longer	pos
if you dont use sheets it will dirty the covers and mattress faster which will either lead to you buying new one sooner or to your bed looking absolutely atrocious	neg
im sure ben thinks he can keep doing what he thinks counts as hard work till the ripe old age of 80 if he really wanted to  unfortunately not all of us have the luxury of producing hot air for a living	neg
ah yes because i strive to be born into and die in the workforce  yes	pos
then whats the point of the government taking out the ss funds out of income for our whole life if we get rug pulled	neg
retirement aside  we fund those programs as workers  its a pyramid scheme in essence but eventually we will get that money back in some percentage	neg
taxpayers dont pay me to retire  its my own fucking money	pos
work till you die  coming from a social media influencer masquerading as a politician  mate you dont work  you accept handouts from a cult for being a mouthpiece of hate for them so they can sit back and not be labeled bigots  fuck off	neg
rich assholes have no business telling working class or anyone at all when they should reap some little benefit from a system they paid into to get a chance at retirement before they are feeble	pos
welcome to the world of conservative grifters	pos
a weasily little man that looks like hes never seen a days worth of hard labour in his life  of course he wants you to work until youre dead	neg
you can tell this asshole never worked a day in his life if he thinks abolishing retirement is a good idea  my dad worked as a machinist for over 30 years and it ruined body  my mom is 69 and still working and she is low key depressed and filled with anxiety	neg
some people have very physical jobs and definitely cant work into their 70s but its hard to explain stuff like that to an asshole	pos
its okay  ill live up to his standard the one he sets with his actions  ill be cowardly loud and obnoxious completely inhumane and most importantly lazy making others work for me while i bitch on the internet for money  what a life	neg
who tf actually takes ben shapiro seriously dude cant even get his wife wet	neg
this is the same guy who says women cant get wet  of course he would say some shit like this	neg
im telling you  without eating the rich  the world is doomed  because most of them are narcissistic sociopaths that are killing our world and stealing our lives  but who cares  humanity is a bunch of idiots aint it	neg
my dad is 68 worked all his life as a tree man and is now working with 11 kidney function and this asshole thinks he doesnt deserve help wtf	pos
that guy has not done a hard days work in his life	pos
ben shapiros job is being a professional bitch  sit in a studio and bitch  thats his whole job	neg
its like he doesnt even consider that normal people have families and hobbies theyd like to pursue and we arent all just trying to suck as much money as we can out of the universe at all times  ben doesnt have a life	pos
also people require purpose   yeah my purpose when im old will be ordering a 5th pina colada while not working jackass	pos
its true though why should they be lazy relying on us to support them there are many jobs as senators and congressmen that need filling	pos
whyyy why is that such a realistic depiction of ben shapiro	neg
devastating the worst person you know  babylonbee  made a good point	neg
surprisingly the babylon bee of all people made this lmao	pos
wow  they have more than one joke	pos
verrryyy good mr  shapiro	pos
bens pulling a happy gilmore to afford that leg bone lengthening surgery	pos
says the man who doesnt work a real job  im sure i could talk into a microphone into my 60s but could i paint houses  probably not	pos
come on being this level dumb is like his trademark	neg
i didnt know i needed this today  thank you internet person	pos
this just in ben shapiro wants you to work until youre 105	neg
the fucks going on with them this is actually funny and not just shit  did their heads die from covid or did a sex worker finally do them in	neg
good  those people are living on our dimes and glad ben called em out	pos
those tea cozys arent going to crochet themselves	neg
is this ai generated spam or satire	neg
let me guess youve seen happy gilmore right	pos
work faster or hell put you on lawn duty	neg
ben shapiro is that kid in class who corrects your grammar but cant tie his shoelaces  a privileged moron who mistakes being a pedant for being profound	neg
love babylonbee	pos
ben has the air of a guy that was president of the debate club in highschool and has ridden that high ever since but he doesnt have the chops to actually be a politician so he just kinda flounders around as a public speaker	neg
age restrictions fine  government wanting a paper trail of everyone who looks at adult content not fine	pos
i think what pornhub is protesting is not the concept of age restrictions but rather the way states are implementing them  they dont want to be the responsible party	pos
i had an ipad from my school in 6th grade  even back then and at that age we knew what vpns could do	neg
its wild to me that a lot of people who support requiring you to register your search history with the government would turn around and tell you theyre in favor of small government	pos
this is a slippery slope  the state requiring your id to be on record is dangerous because now they can easily have a database of people who access these sites  any site in the future that the texas gov deems immoral or wrong can end up the same way  reddit could be next  instagram could be next  why should the state government be able to say what legal sites or content i can and cant look at edit fixed typo	neg
i cant be convinced its a good thing  in the land of freedoms its awfully weird how restrictive the country is getting with deciding on what were allowed to see  like im sorry but fuck them kids i dont care  if not pornhub teens will go to another porn site  theres literally thousands  this is very similar to the bill to ban tik tok imo  just talking points in a bill that doesnt effectively fix the problem they claim to be addressing	neg
i totally understand age restrictions especially for adult content  i grew up when the internet was still 90 unmonitored and i stumbled upon all kinds of r34deviantart fuckery just because i searched pokemon in google images  but being forced to upload an id feels    weirdly invasive if that makes sense the idea of the government seeing everything you look at definitely feels like theyll use it as an excuse to get people fired if they dont like them  they already fire teachers left and right for having onlyfans accounts  even if its unrelated to their workplace   so i wouldnt be surprised if this is just the government wanting another excuse to track every persons move	neg
conservatives we want less govt  also conservatives please upload your id so we know who is looking at what	pos
age restriction is fine if reasonable  but they want you to upload your id to a porn site  its dangerous frankly  wed have another ashley maddison incident probably	neg
parents should be the ones with the responsibility to control online content access not the state  this is just a consequence of ipad parenting	neg
people need to take responsibility for parenting their own damn kids  so much of it from sex ed to driving is pushed off on government institutions or private companies filling the vacuums made by said institutions	neg
yes on some things  i dont want a 13yr old behind the wheel of a car for example  i can see both sides of the argument on this one	neg
i dont believe in censorship  it is a slippery slope  first its id for porn then youtube needs id  before you know it every site you use has your id  privacy is a right and i dont trust most companies to keep my personal and private information secure  you can rate things and suggest that certain content is for people of a certain age but that is it as far as im concerned	pos
its simple enough to ask if the person is above a certain age  will teens lie absolutely  however no website should ever be asking for a photo id  this is just purity talk but in a way that restricts the privacy rights of the people	neg
this happened already in louisiana last year   p  s  use a vpn	neg
they are pretty transparent about it  they do not approve of how texas is handling it  they find it immoral to id every user of their site so they just shut it down because fuck texas	neg
some of you guys who want to ban porn dont even realize how authoritarian you are  not everyone who watches porn develops unrealistic expectations  whatever the fuck you mean by that	neg
when are we going to admit that teenagers have libidos if anything we should be focusing on making sure healthy depictions of sex are available  if you make every semiokay porn site unavailable through age restriction youll just drive teens to circumvent your restrictions by going to the absolute worst parts of the internet e  g  4chan and thats not good for anyone  except maybe predators and by extension conservatives  im 26 and still dealing with developing a healthy relationship with my sexuality after being exposed to awful shit as a kid  teen	neg
they do know vpns work on this right also theres no way texas can require every single site to implement this so all you have to do to access adult content is scroll down a bit anyway  if they really think their constituents would be okay with their government fighting legal battles against thousands of small businesses they are even more disconnected with reality than i thought  every site will probably just fuck off anyway tho	neg
yeah this is not effective  minors that want to view porn are just going to find other ways to do it  this isnt protecting minors this is just making it so everyone that wants to view porn to go threw so many different road blocks	neg
the fact that there was large bipartisan support on the vote  even after trump cane out against it  is what has me concerned  what exactly was in that classified briefing it had to have been serious to get both parties on board	pos
remember when the usa banned certain norton products    vs the rest of the world norton encryptionhard drive erasing feature banned in usa    then all of a sudden they were cool with norton no problem    its almost as if they suddenly didnt give a fuck almost as if norton password restrictions suddenly didnt matter werent an issuecould be cracked at will    the illusion of computer security	neg
its not that tik tok does what other apps do its that tik tok is overseen by the ccp  all social media apps are terrible but they dont have an actual foreign government owning it	neg
the us government is okay collecting its own citizens data but not okay with foreign openly hostile authoritarian regimes doing the same to their people  curious  lmao  china bans google wikipedia facebook etc  because they have security concerns of their own	pos
there is no way so many of you are so uninformed you cant gauge the threat difference between a mean capitalist company and a hostile foreign power lmao    edit guys  the government can already remotely track your phone lmao  if thats what youre scared of its already happened  the difference with tiktok is the chinese government can demand a lot more from their companies than the u  s  government can with far fewer repercussions  they nuked their tech industry and arrestedkilledsilenced their top billionaires	pos
idc if they ban tiktok because i dont really use it but if theyre going to do something they should target both foreign and domestic privacy issues  not just one of them and call it a day	neg
after reading some of what op has said here the consumers in the us are too ignorant of foreign intelligence for them to ever make an educated decision on whether the app is bad for them let alone national security  this is 1000 the sort of thing the government should oversee as it is a matter of national security and protecting citizens from possible false information from nonally nations  also what is this shit about tiktok being the platform of genz i dont use it  most of my friends dont use it or want to  and the ones that do only do it to try and fish out good memes from all the garbage that is on the app  i would be embarrassed to call myself genz if tiktok was used to represent us	pos
imagine if this is what gets gen z to vote lmao	pos
rather my own country have my data than my countrys biggest rival  they can go right on ahead banning it for all i care	pos
the fucking whataboutism but american apps do it    is infuriating its called a good fucking start  i dont think literally anyone says do this to tik tok but not american apps  ban them too or if not force them to respect privacy  do you really think anyone would be against forcing meta to stop selling data the difference is our corrupt government wont do that but that doesnt invalidate that tik tok needs to be dealt with  crazy that this is seen as some gotcha  youre just upset your favorite brain rot little app that has been proven to be malicious is finally facing some kind of regulation  i dont think ive ever met someone who defended tik tok who actually had any brain cells  truly just built to appeal to ignorant people	pos
other apps arent essentially owned by the fucking ccp	neg
its so disappointing how uninformed some of you are  every time im proud of our generation shit like this happens and i see how half of us are exactly like boomers   tiktok is not run by the ccp lmao  its a singaporean company  maybe some politicians care about our data but fir the most part its a colossal powerhouse that keeps millions of us informed and aware  what i love about tiktok most is how easy it is for us to have discourse and call for action  i mean tiktok is basically the reason the recent kellogg boycott actually worked  like i get your redditors but you of all people should be more well informed	pos
they dont care about online privacy or privacy of its citizens in the first place  most of us dont even know about the patriot act or any of the other overbearing legislation they happily passed in years prior	pos
im confident someone will just make a western replacementcopy cat of tiktok if it does actually get banned  then well just flock to that instead	pos
usa has most of the mega tech corps in our own country  whats the big deal in just making our own ticktock like vine was	pos
tiktok is the biggest propaganda machine ever  i get bombarded with farright farleft and conspiracy  only the ones that target my country suspiciously  content even though i never interact with it  its absolutely being used to brainwash westerners into fighting eachother  if goebbels had tiktok wed all be speaking german	neg
most of the comments are rather an evil american capitalist have my data than evil china who do you think theyre selling the data to	neg
tik tok surveillance is notably worse than other apps and it is run by an adversarial government  the bill wont ban tik tok it will just force separate tik tok us from tik tok china	neg
honestly idgaf if china has my data  theres nothing in there that would be of interest to them  if you dont feel secure with tiktok just dont use it  dont ban an app just because you dont feel comfortable with it	pos
the american way	neg
im not american genuine question how tf do you cross from the left side of this pic to the right side do you just run and hope no one runs you over edit for those being passive aggressive and defensive yes i know what a crosswalk is i just cant see any in this image in particular  this wasnt an attack on america relax lol  i was just surprised as where i live there are no highways that pass through residential areas  theyre only used to connect cities  youll have malls restaurants cafes amusement parks car dealerships gas stations etc    along the highway and some houses here and there but not a whole residential area edit 2 wow okay so apparently if youre by that electric pole on the left and you need to go to the green sign on the right you have to walk on that same side of the sidewalk until you find a crosswalk  then you walk all the way back to the green sign  that honestly sounds like a colossal waste of time  either that or hop in a car and drive there  interesting	pos
i live in nyc and go out as much as possible  the other thing is if you live in a city like mine anything other than going to the park or just walking around costs money even getting places costs money  and when you do go out are the strangers outside willing to get to know you eager to get to know you no they want to be on their phones whether theyre 18 or 68  even if you live in a place with third spaces you cant force an interaction in meat space and you cant find a free venue either since nyc gets winters when its cold outside theres essentially nothing to do if youre young and broke  thats not even getting into the mid20s reality that everyone you know is working almost all the time or are unemployed and completely broke and you aint seeing either group of people most of the time	neg
i swear people dont hang out outside because no one else does  like if one kid wants to hang out outside they have no one else who wants to do that as well so they just go back inside and onto their device	neg
nah this is definitely a generation thing in my experience  i went to middle  high school in az and wed just walk around suburbs just like you included in the post and talk  even in 115 degree summer heat i now live in one of the most walkable cities in the us including a paved nature trail spanning 13 miles and still rarely see anyone under 30  this trail even has picnic tables pingpong tables usb charging stations etc todays world is hooked on cheap dopamine and our brains find it much more rewarding to bedrot than to go outside  bad infrastructure certainly doesnt help but it objectively doesnt prevent anyone from spending time outside in most cases	pos
damn i live in a major metropolitan area and have lots of friends and hang out with them a regular amount  sounds like a personal problem	pos
blaming highways on kids not going outside seems like a shitty excuse  i always used to play outside i rode my bike around no problem in the suburbs	neg
i lived in the exact kind of neighborhoods  im 30  and i still went outside and hung out with my friends	pos
many suburbs look exactly the same as they did 30 years ago  no kids playing football in the streets no knocking on doors is xxxx home we want to play some small neighborhoods may have been sprawled out but this isnt the main cause of genz hermitting its phones social media games doomscrolling and addictive and curated algorithms to satiate their need for dopamine  quite obvious really	pos
ummm    this is exactly how it was for millennials  did you think we still didnt go outside and play	pos
lol i skateboarded i see nothing to complain about here  plus looks like it would be easy to find lots of kids to hang out with in pic 2  suburbs have existed for decades its not new  before youd just have your bedroom wall to complain to which would get old so youd go outside to see what you could get into  if you couldnt be social sitting in your house youd go outside  if youre unhappy get off the internet and do something about it instead of complaining  i once found an abandoned warehouse contacted the owner for permission and built a skatepark there held cash competitions your only limitations are yourself  coming from a place of love signed a millennial	pos
america has looked like this since the 50s  teenagers in the suburbs still hung out 20 years ago	pos
roads were like this when i was younger we still were able to go outside  maybe gen zs are too stupid and fat to go outside they rather play shitty video games like fartnite	neg
why cant you just make friends with the neighborhood kids when i was in middle school i would always hang out with my friends who lived in the suburbs and literally just ride bikes or play basketball rather than go back home to my ghetto apartment complex	pos
are you sure you didnt mean to post this in cars circle jerk sub	neg
everything costs too much	neg
i hate this kind of city planning as much as the next person but     did you think this was a recent development suburban sprawl existed for millennials and genxers too and they managed to go outside and socialize with other people  the photos you shared arent a gen z thing  this is what its looked like for multiple generations	pos
does this boy realize that the pictured style of suburb infrastructure has been around for 3 or 4 generations now suburbs and arterial roadways are not the cause of social isolation for gods sake	neg
i get your point but bro shit has been like this since the 50s  what generation are you referring to the people who designed the infrastructure which became the suburbs are now like 100 years old or dead  60s 70s 80s and 90s kids didnt stay indoors cus there were roads and housing developments everywhere	neg
this is    not an argument the existence of roads never once stopped me as kid from playing outside either on my own property or heading down the street to a friends place  it never stopped my friends and i from congregating in the local hangout spot  even when id travel to nyc you were able to walk most places  and theres plenty of transport there to get you to the parts you cant if you wanted to risk getting shanked by a homeless guy but thats another topic for another day   hell my mothers side of the family still lives in nyc and they take the public transport everywhere  so im not entirely sure where any of this is coming from  it seems more like a personal issue than anything else	neg
opposite hot take plenty of kids and teens grew up in neighborhoods and stuff like that decades ago  they fared just fine going outside and doing stuff  its almost as if some online technology and websites came around and changed everything	pos
oversleeping    but now i dont get enough sleep	neg
hah jokes on you i deliberately avoid saying that was the last time in order to not jinx it and avoid the disappointment when it happens	neg
alcohol unfortunately	neg

painkillers   ive quit many times just to come back	neg
sex and porn and more sex and then masturbation    and only sex with strangers with no feelings at all that leaves you feeling unfulfilled	neg

meth and i will not explain further  edit i did in fact explain further	neg
its sad how we all are chained to something  its like the only battle we truly have is ourselves  i hope you guys dont lose the motivation to quit your bad habits	neg

drinking	neg
commenting on fuck politics titled posts on this sub and explaining why politics matters more than they could ever understand	neg
pepsi max  it replaces water for me totally  unhealthy in almost every way but yeah it keep me fucking up all the way	pos

for me its caffeine  i have bipolar and it makes me manic and i really just need to quit but it helps me think so much better	pos
weed  addiction sucks	neg
how big is the sample	neg
gen z is gay af	neg
while this is cool i want to point out that most 99 of people have not taken this survey and that most people refuse to take surveys when offered  source i have run several public surveys on multiple university campuses	pos
why is the increase mostly in the bisexual category	pos
okay ill say it since nobody else will this is expected  when people arent  as  openly ostracized and lynched they tend to be more comfortable selfidentifying edit to everyone commenting its for the trends or advantages please list some  vaguely gesturing at something you dont have proof for is honestly pathetic edit 2 why arent we seeing similar trends among other age groups probably because they were raised in a homophobic world it gets internalized  we also cant ignore the hivaids epidemic	pos
bisexual and smth else are doing a lotta heavy lifting there  sure some people will act different to get attn or whatever  but it kinda makes sense considering most people to be somewhere on the spectrum rather than being rigidly straight or gay	pos
fuckin chill it will plateau eventually  whenever some type of behaviour stops being marginalizedpersecuted it shoots up like crazy and then plateaus  im lefthanded and when i was a kid it was still seen as a bad thing where i was from  same thing with neurodivergent people parents are accepting and not hiding their nd kids which made autism and other once rare  not disclosed  neurodivergent cases way more noticeable	neg
look at all you zoomer bisexuals just winning out there like youve doubled the percentage from millennials	pos
r  i  p  to the silent generation who werent straight	neg
i dont have any proof but i suspect a significant number of this can be traced to people being more educated  more people today understand what it means to be gay lesbian bi trans gender fluid etc  and the more people understand these identities properly the more people are going to recognize feelings theyve been having in the past and present and start to identify with the community	neg
i identify as struggling to survive	neg
gay people from older generations had to live in the closet  my guess is this is much closer to the real number because people feel more comfortable being out now  also keep in mind that every arousal study thats ever been done has shown that a huge number of women are bisexual	pos
i think this is just because of how much more openly accepted it is  and in some cases tolerated  i know in my grandparents era you couldnt openly come out as these which sucks	neg
damn really its almost as if that increase is natural when its actually accepted	pos
because the older generations treatment of lgbtq really settles down to this a   let them die of aids b   killed them c   are still closeted because they were afraid of a and b and are now hateful that they couldnt live their true identities and are trying to take it away from everyone else  love a millennial who has been seeing it their whole life first hand	neg
i think about a hundred years ago sigmond freud said about a third of people are gay or bisexual  but oppression kept the reported number closer of 5  its interesting to see the number settle close to his statement	pos
i hope they all vote	pos
i doubt these results are entirely accurate  id wanna see the survey  but it is definitely true that more people are openly admitting that theyre not straight	pos
the thing is theres a difference between misogynist incels vs lonely guys who are genuinely depressed and hopeless  but the internet hates nuance	neg
male loneliness is def one of the topics thats posted on this sub a lot and makes it to the homepage more frequently than not  so if its all someone sees when they scroll through reddit than yea it makes sense that this is what theyll think	neg
who are we the mod team is staunchly against sexism and incel ideology  discussing male loneliness has nothing to do with inceldom our user base is mostly young males and this sub is for discussing stuff pertaining to our generation  something that is relevant to a huge portion of our user base is naturally going to be talked about  contrary to whats being said i think a lot of our users have pretty sensible takes  our responsibility as mods is to stop hateful things from disseminating within our sub  weve been temporarily short of mods which means there are things we havent been able to moderate and im sorry about that  were just minding our own business but there are subs out there that want to show us in bad light  some quite vocal subs nonetheless that shall not be named that perpetuate the hate  i hope you guys realize that participating in a sub that bases its entire existence on hating the other gender is not good for you or society as a whole  make no mistake we do not condone gender based hatred no matter which side	neg
i mean sometimes	neg
there is some nuance but im pretty sure a bunch of dumbass incels come through here to try and black pill folks  there are plenty of issues that get brought up like say male loneliness that grifters will try to use and they get brought up here about as often as they do on other subreddits  remember folks talking about your problems is fine  falling for that dumbass andrew tateincel bullshit is dumb	neg
i dont think that were an incel sub thats going too far  i do think that tropes often used by misogynists are kind of normalised in our discussions here	neg
talking about the male loneliness crisis isnt misogyny as long as you dont blame women for it	neg
we never talk about mens issues is probably the most common phrase ive heard in the last decade  it does get tiring especially when they blame it on women	neg
yeah this sub is bruh	pos
idk about incel but shit its heading there  how many times do i gotta see women only like attractive  rich men  like damn bro even if that were true just get your level up then	pos
yeah its kind of an incel sub  a lot of girls are bad boys are good posts	pos
guys im really lonely and im thinking of ending things incel	neg
i mean there was that one thread about gen z men becoming more right wing and all the comments were like you reap what you sow   so like yeah not sure why i havent banned this one yet those statistics were flawed btw	pos
as a member of both subreddits in question yall are both just crazy  both subs are constantly taking things too far like yeah twoxchromosomes will always receive manhate well right now genz has had a lot of similar posts about male loneliness it is what it is  im still a woman and im still gen z  i still want access to the rest of the content that i do care about so i stay p	pos
god  this subreddit really does sound incelish	pos
i read the comments for about 30 seconds before i realized that the 2x post is pretty accurate lol	pos
twoxchromes is just misandry twoxchromosomes members have seizures when the possibility of a man suffering is brought up probably the millennial lesbian seething at being memed on   femcels complaining about incels that sub is literally full of grown ass women crying about memes made by 12 year old boys lmao      so are you guys just trying to prove them right because all the top comments are proving them right  i also cannot believe the audacity of trying to claim that sub is filled with terfs its one of the most antiterf subs ive ever seen whereas this one is absolutely fuckin filled with transphobes	neg
is it an incel sub top comment dont take the womenled subs seriously its mostly misandry   im glad the planet is dying	pos
the problem is this loneliness epidemic isnt caused by systemic and political issues that keep other minority groups back  with the exception of the cost of living crisis which affects both genders equally  its largely just dudes that have a bunch of bad habits that make them not attractive  the majority of men who self identify as lonely seem to just not want to take any positive action or responsibility in improving their position in life  theres no systemic prejudice or conservative laws that keep you from not going to therapy joining a gym and buying clothes that fit you  however when this advice is presented to them its immediately met with dismissal and negativity that oh this advice is so dismissive of my issues like what else would you have society do to help men when yall refuse to take the most basic steps to help yourselves  i genuinely think a bunch of gen z men want to play the perpetual victim because its comfortable and easier to blame society instead of taking responsibility for your own happiness	neg
it is the fourth highest in selected countries  it does not have the fourth highest suicide rate in the world	neg
gender equality win for india  women are almost just as suicidal as men	neg
it literally says selected countries  the us is very very far from having the fourthhighest suicide rate	neg
well it does say selected countries   im sure there are a lot of countries that didnt make the study that outperform the us	pos
this is suspiciously similar to rates of alcoholism by country  that stuff is really poison	neg
this is from 2019 pretty sure its even worse currently	pos
damn  russia was top of the list before the war  i dont even think i want to see what its like now	neg
men across the board	neg
who cares that the us is 4th look at the men to women ratio in every country on the list  this is the issue that is never addressed	pos
as a korean this is very sad to see  ignore my username my friend made this account   south korea has a population of around 52 million and yet its 3rd and most of them are probably teens aswell	neg
russias suicide rate is so high due to work ethics that can be described as work till you bleedenobled by laborthen purchase relief from your local retailor   not to mention that new generation of feminism that just undermines the mens problems hit russian youth hard girls dont want to hear abt your problems cause man up	neg
italians living the good life  sun pasta red wine and beautiful woman  what else could you want	pos
what happening with korean girls	neg
so we finally surpassed japan     ironic	neg
this is a stupid list  first is from 2019 second they just picked random countries and called it a day third its from 2019	neg
wait the west is not supposed to surpass the asian countries  damn	neg
this is not equitable  we must address this gender gap	neg
white man privileges am i right s	pos
south africa has the second highest suicide rate	neg
i wonder if gen z will ever respect how close we were to basically eliminating nicotine addiction from society until these fucking vape companies popped up  teen smoking was down to like 10	pos
i would expand that to _instant gratification_ whether thats nicotine porn instagram tiktok reddit alcohol fastfashion cannabis video games gambling    we live in an age of gluttony and consumption and its never been easier to get that instant dopamineserotonin boost without actually needing to work for it  learning to overcome that desire and be disciplined enough to work for the delayed gratification like learning that skill accomplishing that task or perusing that dream is so incredibly important  now more than ever	pos
education  imo the biggest blunder our parents made was not educating us properly themselves  they wouldnt talk to us directly telling us to ask the school our friends or the internet  education varies so much from place to place that parents need to understand what is being taught  parents also need to fill in the gaps that the school wont teach  and the internet needs to be kept as far away from kids as humanly possible  parents need to be more involved in their kids lives  its going to be uncomfortable and awkward but parents are the ones with the most control here  sit your kids down and talk to them  answer their questions as best as you can no matter what they are  tell them the truth about the internet porn nicotine etc  and dont just scold and yell at them because thats only going to make them want to do it more  fucking talk to them	pos
knowledge  i think it comes down to being transparent and honest about our own experiences  and also acknowledging that there are just some things we cannot protect our kids from we saw the consequences of being completely shielded away from exposure to certain uncomfortable truths  we also have to be advocates for mindful consumption because yeah i think alcoholism is bad as much as the next guy but also beer tastes pretty good  i love having beer from time to time	pos
we cant completely stop them from accessing porn or vapes but we can deter them from it  we can create content on social media to help them understand the risksdangers to vaping  we can also help them understand what porn does to our minds  we can lead them in a different direction by influencing them  we do this by telling them our experiences with vaping and pornography  we will never be able to stop them from doing it  we can at least warn them about this stuff because quite honestly a lot of werent warned  a lot of did not think we would eventually become addicted to this stuff  a lot of our generation werent thinking that their first juul would lead to an addiction  a lot of us werent thinking that first porn video we watched would cause harm and affect us mentally  we may have fallen for the trap but we can warn our brothers and sisters in the next generation of them	pos
so life expectancy in 1960 was 71 years old  today life expectancy is 78 years old  we went through over 80 years of progrerss massive cultural and social changes thousands of new labs and research universities built around the world trillions spent and only got a couple extra years of life  and the crazy thing is that half of the population in 1960 smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol casually  so what we need to do is continue discouraging smoking continue to develop medicine and turn culture and lifestyle back to exactly the way life was lived in 1960 specifically  this should increase lifespan about 10 years at least	neg
younger millennial here most of my apprentices at work who vape have never smoked a cigarette in their life and it blows my mind  i still smoke darts so im not judging the addiction its just makes me sad that they still got hooked anyways	neg
same thing we did for cigarettes  1  make them seem lame 2  a fuckload of psas explaining the dangers  kids make dumb choices but they arent actually dumb	neg
lmao as if  we got the most antinicotine and antismoking propaganda thrown at us than any other people in all of history and yall still jumped down the throats of big tabaco as soon as they made it possible to smoke in school without getting caught	pos
god i cant wait for your puriteens to grow up so i can stop seeing these posts  happens to every generation bro	neg
by ostracizing druggies and not linking a boys sense of masculinity and social worth to the number of girls he can get into bed with  put a kids attention on building themselves up  teach them that accomplishment takes effort and above all else time  that instant gratification and constantly chasing fads is a horrid lifestyle  maybe youll stop the kids from doing dumb things like that tide pod nonsense  or that fad where theyd get social media likes for randomly attacking people while streaming  and above all else no personal cell phonesipads before college	neg
umm before phones and internet we did the same stuff  we just had to do it differently  i dont think the behavior has changed just the way we access things  we are not that different and it likely will be the same  nicotine  when i was a young teen i would get together a couple dollars go to the store and ask adults to buy me cigarettes  this actually worked especially if you could get a dollar more near a liquor store and let the person buying the smokes buy themselves a beer  in that time for me it was illegal for a minor to buy cigarettes but totally legal to possess and consume them  so after you got them you were fine  porn  everyones dad had a stash somewhere  wed have to find that stash and get the porno magazine  like going through garages and drawers  wed get lucky and get a hold of porn pretty often  then we would take whatever illicit thing we got a hold of to a lake where there was a wooded area and smoke the cigarettes and look at the porn even dividing up the bounty so we could you know look in private  with that said the most kinky porn i remember someone getting was a magazine about pregnant women  there wasnt a wide variety of porn or kink  statistically i guess we and those before us had more actual sex  since all interactions were face to face if you wanted to talk to someone you liked you had to be with them in person or call the family home which was the one phone everyone shared  in later teenage years when we had cars we would get booze weed grab our girlfriendboyfriends if we had them and drive to a camp ground  like 1617 years old in the middle of the forest with only maybe a checkup from a park ranger once to make sure we werent being dumb with our campfire  the only thing i think the new generations are missing out on is the freedom of leaving the house all day to get into reasonable amounts of trouble rather than having so much of that in a box  the getting into trouble and figuring out how to responsible with these things is important  the one thing that has not changed is adults telling kids they never did anything like that  i just want to tell you we did  just be careful and respectful  i dont think you or the next generation need saving but honest conversations about healthy use of powerful and sometimes if done wrong danger of things like sex and drugs  if were being honest we can tell you the absolutely dumb scary and even tragic things that happened so you can be less dumb at least about those things  and also importantly the good memories and fun of figuring this stuff out  and here i guess ill expand on something else i would advise teens and do more of the older guy rant  since you all have such easy access to porn and dont need to be a low key  if im using your terminology correctly  criminal to get it and look at it  porn is not educational it is a performance and partner satisfaction is paramount  try to get out of your head and into each others  porn doesnt really work for this its about your pleasure and sex itself is collaborative  i dont think porn is bad but just not educational or real life  i was lucky to have a girlfriend who let me clumsily eat her out for hours until i figured out how to do it really well for her and that was so much more satisfying than any porno i could get a hold of  as an adult i appreciate her patience  also go outside and talk to each other in real life more its nice and its good for you	pos
not have them	neg
i really wish we could go back to the times where we all left the phones at home connected to the wall and big ass clunky computers  and just less sociopathic children	neg
i didnt get my first phone until i was 15  social media until i was 13  no video games cause of the price  only electronics i had were converter box tv and desktop computer	neg
ive yet to see a single person provide actual evidence that porn has caused any issues for our generation  all i see is well i think i watch too much porn because i had a phone so everyone else does too   with absolutely no scientific basis behind it	neg
this reddit is no lifers outing themselves to each other on repeat all week long all year long  i need to mute this shit because i dont know what to do but shake my head and feel bad for yall	neg
being better parents  thats the answer to just about every issue with children  if you look at people with great parents they are in most cases fine	pos
youre looking at it with rose tinted glasses if you think we got addict to pornography and especially nicotine early compared to previous generations older gens might not have had phub but they had magazines and other forms of pornography that 12 year olds were already using as for nicotine hello it wasnt uncommon for kids to be smoking in the 1950s up to like the 80s and 90s	pos
every generation has been addicted to nicotine and porn at an early age  i was born in 93 and my mom says they used to able to buy packs of ciggs at like age 8	pos
not a man but i do gotta agree with both sides  like yeah im lonely and single and have been for nearly four years  some days i have dark thoughts about how maybe im just not good enough for a relationship  but the thing i have to keep in mind is that its a twoway street and feeling bad for myself wont make it any better	pos
eh itll go away once they realize how impractical living with this mindset is  it happened to me and itll happen to them too once they actually try to date	neg
i think every young guy is going to feel a lot of these emotions  when i was like 1822 i thought i was a loser with no friends who couldnt get a girl but hell i had girlfriends hook ups all the normal stuff really it just never felt satisfying really so youre still lonely  eventually you get old enough to realize that sort of stuff wasnt going to fill the void  you really do have to just cultivate your life enough to find meaning relationships careers etc  its almost inevitable to feel like detachment as a young person in our modern age  i do worry for kids who lost much to covid	neg
the thing about anger and loneliness is that theyre strangely comforting  getting healthy is incredibly painful and a lot of people dont take the necessary steps to do so  when you compound how the isolation of covid fucked everyones social development its no wonder people are falling down extremist rabbit holes  i work with teenagers and have found that many have never actually been challenged on what they believe which is really sad to see	neg
i wasnt really fucked from the pandemic  mostly because i was always an indoor person in the first place  also if 64 of men are single then who are the women ending up with  ignoring lesbians	pos
dating apps have helped to propel these negative stereotypes  their algorithms match people with those who dont take care of themselves and it creates the perception that everyone of that gender is that way	neg
yeah this is a pretty succinct perspective on the epidemic  im sure there are many causes but it does seem like there are a fuckton of guys who just lack the emotional intelligence to realize how theyre struggles are being targeted for propaganda movements	pos
social media feeds vulnerable men both validation and ragebait antifeminism  but i also think these two things wouldnt have so much traction if there wasnt also a popular culture of ignoring or straight up bashing young men with problems  not everything needs to be about who has more or less inherent privileges when interacting with individuals  somewhere along the way we conflated confronting systemic problems with confronting specific people and i dont think its achieved the progress that we wanted it to	neg
i think a big part of the problem is that its good advice mixed with bad  the advice you originally listed for how to deal with loneliness is not necessarily bad advice  going to the gym talking to people and trying to find a new hobby is all great advice if youre feeling lonely  so ifwhen that starts working you start to believe that maybe some of the other crazier shit they say might also be true	neg
as someone who was falsely accused of sexual assault and has been sexually assaulted by both a man and a woman i dont even care anymore  i just want out of debt and to be left the fuck alone	neg
its honestly very simple  times are much harder financially for everyone people arent dating out of love people are dating out of survival you could be a great person but if you cant support or entertain someone like they see on social media all day you arent worth it  theyll learn their lesson later on when theyre strapped with a couple of kids from someone who they thought loved them	pos
ngl im still constantly angry at what i was forced to go through in 2020 and 2021  i was in a great spot in 2019 and then that fucking pandemic and the overzealous response to it fucked everything up  i lost a full ride scholarship and dropped out of uni right after my freshman year as a result of the online classes  i started at community college in 2022 to finish my associates and should be graduating this semester so im only just now getting to where i should have been in spring of 2021 but now i dont have an easy path forward to afford my bachelors since i dont have that scholarship anymore  im pissed  i want revenge but theres no clear path to take to get it  is it rational no  but thats still how i feel	neg
honestly getting with my friend since 1st grade as my girlfriend really helped me  i cant say the same for other guys but despite being kind of awkward i had some moments in my life that gave me the confidence to talk to women as they say  my best advice for guys is to remember that women and men are more similar then they are different and go through a lot of the same struggles as people  dont hate women as a whole just because a few women have rejected you or been unkind to you and always remember the times women have been good to you  i mean just start with your own mother as an example of a good woman in your life if she is a positive force that is	pos
nothing at all like sitting in your dorm in the early70s waiting for your reclassification to 1a with a report date	neg
online interaction isnt real or healthy  growing up on social media and with distraction machines is awful	neg
i dont think it was always this way  it could have been but it seems like young men used to be more at peace with themselves in the 70s and earlier even if they werent having sex  so whats changed  my guess less social interactionisolation  social media our culture has become overly focused on sex every song ig post etc basically says you need to be having sex or youre a loser and thats not true	pos
im a millennial and have been single for all 35 of my years  i was homeschooled abused and isolated  the level of loneliness i experience is something i consider to be a different animal  everyone gets lonely thats universal  loneliness that gnaws at you year after year and feels insurmountable  to the point that you feel so broken that you could never learn how to be in a relationship  thats something else  and im here to say that its still possible to be this lonely and lead a good life that doesnt harm demonize or blame others  i know the desperation i know that being given any kind of answer to that desperation is alluring  for anyone in that mindset right now please hear me being drawn into those rabbit holes will not solve your own problems and it will cause harm to yourself and others  focus on what makes you feel at peace or happy on your own dont base any of your pursuits or selfworth on what other people say  a ton of young people do not understand that feelings and actions can be separate  dont police your emotions around this because it is hard  despair is real isolation is read dont gaslight yourself  the key is to honor the very real pain youve been through without acting on those heavy overwhelming feelings in a way that involves others who have no idea what youve been through  they cannot possibly know how lonely or isolated you are  as someone who has been perceived as female male and nb ive seen the different sides of how genders get treated  men are socially isolated in many ways  women are targeted disproportionately for all types of violence  please internalize that reality and then realize that violence is scarier and worse than being lonely  again i know loneliness  violence is worse  be part of the solution  finally any young person reading this who feels unattractive youre someones dreamboat i promise  even if you have literally been told every day of your life that youre ugly  people experience attraction across many more dimensions than physical beauty and being a good kind person makes you immediately more attractive  good luck folks	neg
it sucks but it is nobodys fault but their own that they arent getting laid  turning into an incel and shaming women isnt okay	neg
i would not consider myself lonely ive got friends and family i just lack the romantic relationship and honestly its probably the best for me  i think that some men overvalue the importance of being in a relationship they need to step back and think if they really need it  i asked myself this question years ago and my answer is no i dont need it  guys be better and move on	pos
the statistical reality is that up to 50 of the current 15 to 30 crowd will be single for life	neg
gen x loves to end text in ellipsis ive noticed theyll be like how was your day      its so funny to me	pos
i mean it depends on context  if youre writing out multiple sentences like i am right now periods are literally just    there  its a stop in the sentence  but theres a huge difference between im fine and im fine   i wont believe the second one  edit wanted to add to this since apparently people are learning here  a period along with just a shift towards proper grammar in general adds gravity to your statement thats the best way to put it  other examples are dont do that again vs dont do that again   or come out here vs come out here   if you normally text with full grammar and punctuation and the people you talk to are used to it then i mean youre probably fine  context clues are the most important part of this  but texting someone new means they gotta get used to what is essentially your speech pattern in text	pos
i studied under lauren lovely lass  i think id probably assume someone was angry at me if they just texted something like ok	pos
it depends on your usual typing style tbh  like if you usually use periods its no big deal because theyre expected  but if you usually dont then using a period is a deliberate choice	pos
in casual conversation yes  if i receive a discord message from a close friend of mine and theyre ending all their sentences with periods i will assume something is wrong lol	pos
no  nonissue theyre trying to stir a shit storm	neg
its not true for me but ive heard of people getting upset  im going to leave soon okay this is received as the fact that im leaving has been acknowledged   im going to leave soon okay   this is received as oh  maybe they didnt want me to leave  did i do something wrong because of this i constantly just add    to the end of basically every message because i can come off as rude  maybe its just the autistic in me that constantly forces a smile in real life but it seems to work	neg
first using linguistic resources to convey emotional states is not something new  in a casual conversation with someone youre not usually formal with well yeah  it is going from a casual tone to a business tone  it doesnt apply to people who always use them	pos
never rings true till they hit you with an okay  in that word the period rings with passive aggressiveness	neg
ive had people tell me that before from gen z so its not a completely untrue statement  i find it hilarious tho tbh	pos
i hate that i do sense shade or somth when theres a period in a dm  and my bf will even admit hes feeling off or upset when i ask him if hes ok  after i notice tiny things like a period or lack of abbreviations or emojis or we   its ridiculous but rings true	pos
are people just talking in run on sentences now wtf	neg
all generations had illiterates we just didnt give ours a platform	neg
yall cant stand punctuation anymore	neg
ngl when my partner and i message each other and we use periods its our way of subtly expressing that something is wrong or were being serious  otherwise i dont really give a damn lmao	pos
personally if the overall message seems curt and periods are used  especially on the last sentence  i would view that as a bad sign  the use of periods alone does not make a message aggressive	neg
i mean    um no  like if someone who wasnt doing so before starts using full stops i might think somethings up but like other than that the column writer is just trying to be an ass for no reason	neg
depends on the person but that used to make me think people were annoyed  lol what really gets me though is when middle aged people add random ellipses at the end of their sentences  could be a totally mundane thing and they end it with    like they just said something thats going to cause tension	pos
nope i use periodsfull stops all the time  even in texts  i usually avoid slang and type formally	neg
im fine  see you probably read that in a negative tone because you associate the period with an abrupt finish  its not nescesarily a problem like this article is making it out to be but its an interesting linguistic development seeing how tone can still be imparted through written messages	pos
or go a step further like the democrats force them to sell their inventory  over a 10 year period  of single family homes  44 of single family homes were gobbled up by private equity last year  halting it doesnt bring back the ones the greedy bastards already got	neg
hes late to the discussion  democrats have been calling for this for a while now  still  rare w from this psychopath  to be clear its a good idea to ban large private equity firms from buying single family homes  the occasional momandpop investor who owns a few extra rental properties so they can have an additional income stream in retirement isnt the bad guy here	pos
we need this across the usa  especially california  id also love to make it so first time homebuyers get the first say  if you already own a home and try to get another and put in a bid with a first time homebuyer youre bid is null unless the first time home buyer retracts their offer	pos
for the record democrats have been calling for this for years  hes just trying to win votes before the election by finally doing his job  hes a piss baby but even a piss baby cooperates every once in a while	neg
what difference does it make if youre being bent over a barrel by blackstone vs local mom and pop the answer of course is that it doesnt and the op wont actually solve the problem  we need to make it easier for people to build housing  the only reason corporations are in housing at all is because its a good investment  make it a bad investment and theyll happily jump out and never return	pos
holy shit i would love it so much if this went into law  im sure some shithead company will sue the government forever so it never goes into effect	neg
that sounds good  but its greg abbot  so i dont believe hell do it  and if he does i doubt he does it right	pos
greg abbott is a violent fascist and anyone posting pictures of him is propagandizing you	neg
yall dont be fooled abbot is likely only pushing this to gain the votes of young people a demographic which the entire republican party is struggling to gain the support of  remember that this is the man who wants to murder immigrants strip women of their rights and participates in voter suppression against counties that dont align with his party	pos
too bad his constituents will 100 shoot it down being the people buying all the single family homes in the first place	neg
why just single family there needs to be a shift from only single family homes to apartments duplexes and rowhouses	neg
yeah focus on the shiny object while hes out there banning porn destroying reproductive freedom and openly calling for the extermination of immigrants	pos
hault halt	neg
can people really not spell halt	neg
oh good less investment in the housing market  jesus christ just fucking build more houses  prices dont magically go up because corporations bad  they go up because 1  they are a monopoly  clearly not the case here rental supply is one of the most competitive market environments  2  demand is outpacing supply  clearly the case  instead of rent control we have instituted build control in the form of zoning restrictions and onerous requirements levied on builders	pos
sooo let me tell you this is not going to solve the housing issue  one investors are all incorporated it just makes their business life easier  the guy with 4 dudes that drywalls the houses he remodels himself yeah hes incorporated  so if he cannot by that busted home down the street and fix it up to resell it it is going to stay busted  all this is going to do is make it harder for older homes to be renovated and resold which limits the supply further  not only that but it prevents investors from buy tear downs and replacing them as well  this especially hurts the first time home buyer aka gen z  the majority of these investoers are buying trash homes and fixing them up because they can get more profit buying the ones in bad conditions  these are homes that your average first time buyer is not going to have the skills the money or the time to actually fix the home themselves	neg
call me when the bill passes the texas legislature  he doesnt get credit for calling for things he has to actually do them	neg
good idea  fyi its spelled halt	pos
im telling you guys  if you keep voting blue youll be broke  this is a very good thing	pos
this is super out of character for him	pos
i was around 10 when all the mcdonalds started to remove the play places and got rid of all the mascots  it was like watching my childhood die in real time	neg
it mirrors my decline from a happy child to a depressed adult	pos
cant stand it  theyre doing this with every chain and store around where i live  you drive by and its just    grey concrete buildings over and over  i hate that color is being removed from our everyday places	neg
i hate how sanitized and boring the new design is	neg
mcdonalds died the day they stopped serving snack wraps	neg
oh everything that was beautiful in the world is now dead and we have killed it	neg
i prefer the new design because im not a colorful person at all and im very minimalistic  but the clown  that always scared the shit out of me   and the colors of the original mcdonalds does have sentimental value  i dont eat there anymore though	pos
i think for a lot of people the older design is mostly nostalgia speaking cause i absolutely cant stand the older look even though its what i grew up with  it feels super dated and while i do think the new designs could use a bit of colour i prefer the new look	pos
sad but bright colors stress me out so meh its not that terrible if youre wondering theyre doing this to increase the resell value of the properties  selling a modern pizza hut and turning it into something else is simple but we all know those old pizza huts that failed had to be sold and now theres a random ass place with the pizza hut roof  also because i live in the middle of fucking nowhere in a poor country my local mcdonalds still has the old colors and even the playground	neg
looks soviet	neg
it makes me sad and i dont even like mcdonalds	neg
boring sterile corporate greed lack of artistic flare and brand recognition because the same wallstreet people own everything	neg
lets be honest the colors are nostalgoc but the overall design of old was childish  i like the sleek new look  not hot on the gray but oh well	pos
i hate it  bring back the charm	neg
its a bit strange to remove strong branding  theyre clearly trying to look more like a restaurant but theyre not fooling anyone  theres also the advantage of it being easier to convert a mcdonalds to something else when it shuts  some companies have such good branding it makes me enjoy their products on its own and mcdonalds used to make me want to buy their food for its aesthetic appeal  but a lot of corporate initiatives are power grabs by execs since sputters of intense profit are more rewarded than longterm gains	pos
i think its because of a shift in architectural thought  also cost cutting as well i assume	pos
how did white people manage to colonize themselves	neg
mcdonalds had a bad rep for being unhealthy and the design was targeted towards kids  they switched to a nondescript design that is now just a building that serves food  i think its fine  plus those playgrounds were always disgusting	neg
unpopular opinion i actually kinda like it its clean  maybe its my wierd aversion to old 90s era stuff that just kinda creeps me out but i just like the new version better  old one makes me think of dirty plastic tunnels with 20 diseases and ringworm sitting all over the place	pos
since they erased ronald mcdonald they also tried to erase every trace left by his legacy	neg
thats because we havent been earning shit  it used to be oh im doing so well with my pre tax income then the damn government takes their slice and puts me in a world of stress  now we can plainly see even if our income was taxed at 0 we still arent making enough to afford these prices	pos
just use the political flair  everybody has seen this meme before so its less of sharing a meme than it is you being attention grabbing by making people think its a proper meme when its really just politics	pos
i used to be pretty left wing but ive moved closer to the center as ive got older  ive never leaned towards the right politically and i dont ever see my self being socially conservative  i think my shift towards the center has more to do with learning about how politicsthe economy actually works combined with a general disdain for populism	neg
me making a good living only makes it more apparent to me how unfair the system is for a lot of people	neg
to be fair youre still too young for that to apply to you  they mean once you reach your midtolate thirties and are actually making the kind of money you need to buy a house	pos
ive only gotten more left over the years in college and after	neg
i started becoming more to the left when i was able to start grasping political concepts  before that i just believed what my parents did  republicans   without understanding anything  in my mid 20s now and im not quite as left as i used to be but im far from right and i vote blue edit to add obligatory i hate the two party system and wish that we had actual options	pos
it doesnt happen right away it happens when a younger generation comes around and changes what it means to be liberal underneath you	neg
i agree  i was centerright in my teen years  now im on the left	pos
im the opposite of whoever talked at me last	neg
during my teenage years my household was divided  i presented myself as a right wing christian but really i was a closeted queer and atheist  ill be 22 soon and being a young adult in the us has shifted my views completely  i dont consider myself anything in politics  i simply believe that the us government is just a fucking rich people game where the wealthy enjoys the rotten fruits of their greed and the impoverished are slaves to it  in short i still try to participate in movements and protests that expose the corruption of our country while simply wanting nothing to do with the propaganda  its hard to believe anything you see these days but i make sure to stay properly informed on current events	neg
i was right leaning when i was a teenager but now im the typical gen z liberal	neg
im a millennial and i am living the american dream  i am one of the few who owns her own house  i am happily married and engaged to another partner in a poly amorous lifestyle  i am left as fuck  if anything ive gone harder left as i get older  i am 39 now	pos
im living quite comfortably for my age but if i could snap my fingers and make capitalism disappear i wouldnt hesitate	pos
im an old xer and im with you  the older i get the further left i go  i dont know how to fix this broken world but ive got a pretty good idea of which side is doing the breaking and i want nothing to do with them	pos
for me it was going from the top right quadrant of the political compass to the bottom right quadrant of the political compass	pos
american conservatism is the product of indoctrination cronyism and exploitation not unbiased genuine societal growth	pos
yeah i agree tbh i am much more left wing but cautious as i learn about the atrocities on our more authoritarian counterpart with ml and maoistsstalinists  id classify myself as more of a mix of anarchist democratic socialist and social democrat	pos
i work for a fortune 50 making 75k a year  have only gotten more left wing	neg
i was a marxist in hs cant really relate	neg
if youre in crisis or depressed please dial your suicide hotline  you have a right to live there is hope	neg
i can relate to this  ive never had friends my entire life  im so lonely  been thinking of me dying since 12yo  suicidal since 14yo  mines ptsd and my current situation tho  im in my bed the entire day too  i dont go for a run or anything really  i just play vid games watch some tv shows etc while pretending to study bc i have to study 10hrs a day  i study 0 bc idgaf abt anything anymore   i havent self harmed in nearly a year now tho  i wanna say im getting better but i just wanna stop existing yk i hate my life and i feel like im a shitty af person who doesnt deserve to live  my entire family  and country  is homophobic af  parents are trying to change for me but my dad didnt even let me buy a hoodie i liked bc it was pink   but im not even strong enough to do it	neg
try joining some activities outside of college or in college that way you can meet more people easier   trust me life can be a lot more beautiful than this im 20 years old too and ive been through this you can do it too	pos
ive been there too not quite suicidelevel but not far from it  i dont know any easy andor fast solution but suicide definately isnt one  even though it might not look like it your life has a lot of value and potential and its only waiting for you to find it	neg
have you seen a psychiatrist recently im not a doctor but this clearly sounds like massive depression  you need treatment	pos
im actually in a pretty similar situation but i decided a while ago that i wont kill myself despite how much i may want to because its what my opps would want  good luck with your situation though maybe invest in a hobby	pos
it is true that we do have a loneliness epidemic and you are experiencibg it first hand  3rd places are slowly being phased out    however the thing is that nothing in life is ever stagnant  good times end and thibgs get worse yes but by the same logic bad times must also inevitably end and so will your sorrows  there is no need for such a permanent solution especially since your problem is not  if you were told you only had a year left to live what would you like to do in that year even if its nit feasible  just thunk aboyt it really fantasize about it  having someone you can spend time with is a blessing but dont let that stop you from finding a good online community in which you feel appreciated  maybe a smaller themed discord server personally im in a yugioh discord server and keeps me company  dont be afraud to approach people who are already in cliques and of course learn about yourself  why are you how you are what do you like what do you dislike use that knowledge to look for people you are truly compatible with  read up on neurotypical and nd ways of being neurotypes tend to form their own enclaves  youll find your crowd though it is uncertain when but it is also inevitable  maybe itll end up being your parents or cousins even  let yourself find out youre worth it	pos
im 24 but i was in a similar situation to you when i was 20 largely because of covid  i still struggle with a lot of it so i dont really feel qualified to give advice  you should definitely see a therapist if you can sometimes just having someone to vent to can be such a massive help  do you like yourself in your opinion is your lack of friends because you had bad friends to begin with or is there something internal about yourself that you could improve some day i think having an answer to that would help guide you	pos
hey  im the same age as you and im sorry  i have an anxiety disorder with a tendency toward ocd so i know the feeling of being mentally miserable  i sometimes feel hopeless about my future but its waaay too early to give up  i wish i could offer an easy answer but if you want to talk im open	pos
i had difficulty making friends in college  right now things are improving for me and i would say what helps is just being the person that approaches and takes interest in others without expecting much in return  also going to college clubs helped me a lot so theres that i guess  though if you have depression  as in diagnosed depression  i dont know how much cookie cutter advice helps tbh  im a pessimistic person and there are aspects i hate about my circumstance but i havent ever been suicidal so i dont know what helps there	pos
first off what games do you play	pos
im so sorry youre going through this  i thought about suicide when i got a debilitating chronic illness when i was 24  just remember it doesnt really matter whether you die now or die in 50 years  you will still eventually achieve the peace you want right now  why not stick around and see if things change literally anything can happen you just have no idea how your life is going to turn out  especially when youre this young  im 39 now and i still suffer almost every day  but its worth it for the good moments that come about and my life is much better in so many ways because i stuck with it and figured shit out  so much of it is just the mindset you hold every day  that definitely can change it may take a while before youre able to get to that point  but that very much can change too  good luck	pos
im writing this out really fast cause i have to run to work but i didnt want to forget this  because i really feel what youre saying and i see you  im 24 now  ive suffered with depression and other issues all my life but they really came to a head in college where i fell into a massive depression thoughts of suicide totally isolated  and the moment things started to feel like they might be getting better covid hit  just an awful nightmare  first off things got so much better after college for me  most of my friends now also went through significant depression and loneliness in college  i say friends now cause it did happen eventually haha but i wasnt dealing with any of those problems that were troubling me and about 9 months ago after a significant mental break i ended up attempting suicide in about    4 different extremely messy ways and ended up checking myself into a psychiatric facility  traumatizing as it was being locked up in a place with a bunch of other people my age who were hurting just as much or more than me taught me a lot about myself and what i actually had to offer others  since i got out i have 1   gotten on the proper medication after having tried several that didnt work 2   getting proper additional diagnoses that could be medicated properly 3   found a therapist who i really connect with  i suggest finding someone younger you feel you can relate to  and really put in the work and was open and did my very very best to communicate my feelings  it was really hard but that was the single most important thing for me these things have literally changed my life  and they can change yours too  the other thing that really sent me into changing for the better was just making a big change in my life  i moved i got a new job in a whole new line of work and through all of this i was able to find new people who could be my friends and theres really wonderful people all over the place  the key to connecting with others is openness and kindness  be friendly help your coworkers be sensitive to others feelings remember things about them and be real about yourself and your feelings  we are all human and we are always looking to connect with other people  the biggest thing that changed my life was trying to be truthful about myself open and kind  let people in and dont be afraid of showing your true self  you have so much more to offer people than you know right now  but youre so fucking young truly you will be a totally different person in two years let alone two years after that  we are all one soul and we are more the same than we will ever be different  anyway i have to run 15 minutes ago but seriously get some help get someone to talk to make a change  youve got this  feel free to reach out	pos
hello im in the same boat right now im your age and its so hard to make friends i dont know why like nobody wants to form relationships but im always reminded of the importance of networking like how am i supposed to network if everyone is too busy with their lives i really wanna have friends but idk how	pos
covid didnt help our situation at all	neg
dont do it  no matter how bad things get you can always come back from whatever situation with enough effort and time spent being consistent and patient  im 23 and have been back and forth and all over the place with many of the same issues youve described but ive come to realize that a lot of things in this life are out of our control but that doesnt mean you give up  to tell you the truth most of us young adults are barely making it and we spend a lot of time working or studying and feel too tired to meet new people or they just dont want too simply due to how most people are now a days which i get that totally  the only thing that i can suggest is that you get out there and meet people through hobbies or something similar and dont rely on others company to keep you happy  learn to love yourself and dont ever give up	pos
please dont  that is all just please dont  shit will get better	pos
3 things 1 keep excersicing 2 try making your own project that you see could be fixed  use government support to scale it up and make a place for people to work and enjoy life the way you need others to do right now  you are by far not the only one feeling cast out and looking for a place to rest and enjoy life  3 watch some great anime  frieren is hot right now and my personal favourite after is the apothecary diaries or kutsuriya no hitorigoto  the frieren one is called  after journeys end or sousou no frieren	pos
ah yeah  i dont miss it alt all lol life in my early 20s was blah  its gonna sound corny as hell but thats only because its true things will get better  i actually had a lot of friends during my early college years  i had my own clique had an onold girlfriend etc    but guess what all of that is gone now that im nearly 30  and tbh i dont really miss any of it  i feel more like myself now than i did then  i feel more confident than ever before and here i am single as heck basically no friends but im doing all right  my health is better than when i was younger and my outlook has improved too  basically i just made peace on things that i used to let bug me to no end  im comfortable with being me and im comfortable with always wanting to improve and trying new things	pos
so i have a similar story  most of my high school friends just faded into the background for seemingly no reason  and in my mid twenties my best friend totally abandoned me when i told her i really needed help and was thinking about putting an end to it all  but i never acted on it and just kept dealing with the loneliness on my own and pushing forward to figure out who i was and what i may like to do with my life  i found new hobbies i loved and reconnected to old ones i had neglected  i got a degree in a field im passionate about  and the best thing i did was started just enjoying the time i got to spend doing exactly what i wanted when i wanted eating what i wanted and leaving when i wanted because i didnt have to consider anyone else  however i would always talk to stangers when i went out to different events and whatnot and that was kind of enough for me  because of that time i entered my 30s loving to do stuff by myself and almost never noticing i was lonely anymore  that has been such a gift in my life  then within the last couple years i moved and met the most wonderful partner ive ever had and while i now love my independence hes made life even better for sure  i still do sometimes wish i had more girl friends but honestly i dont have much free time to give to more relationships  so all this to say life can be fully enjoyable on your own  and while youre out doing that stuff on your own you might make some friends that will share common interests and passions which could end up being be longer lasting relationships  as well even though life may seem so difficult right now there really can be times in the future you would look back and say im so glad i stayed  i truly hope things get better for you	pos
in highschool yeah but theres no way these people can survive outside of highschool  its like trying to reintroduce an injured otter to the wild after they were in captivity for years its just not going to end well	pos

i always find pennies on the ground everywhere it aint much but its something	neg
my reality has just shifted  this explains a lot  or it could also be that majority of us use digital currency as opposed to physical  its not actually a good thing but it happens	neg
its almost like a majority of people dont use cash anymore	pos
my wife found 400 in a cross body bag she bought at the thrift a couple months ago	neg
i think that has more to do with people using digital currency and credit cards more than actual physical cash these days  theres less lost money because theres less physical money to lose	neg
this is why we rob banks	neg

the reason though is that we tend to use less real physical money and rather digitalcard payment methods	neg
i used to drive around and randomly throw cash out the window	neg
what happened i kinda live under a rock so could someone explain whats up with this	neg
ban tik tok then make vine 2 take us back to the glory days	neg

it wouldnt be funny it would be sad that it took that to get banned  shouldve been banned earlier	neg
while it would be kind of funny i mostly want tiktok to get banned because its mind numbing spyware	neg
its a great platform  the idiocy spreads because its ridiculous to watch and is easy clickbait  but theres soooo much helpful and knowledgeable content on tiktok its ridiculous  my algorithm doesnt even pick up the stupid shit  plus theres so many tiktoks that get crossposted to reddit and a ton of redditors just chime in  you guys like tiktok too  you just hate to admit it	neg
most of social media should be banned or highly regulated	neg
the ban isnt for just tiktok the wording specifies any foreign website that the government deems a national security risk  this isnt about tiktok its about censorship	neg
and there goes more than half of reddit content as well	pos
kind of sad seeing all the hate on here  theres plenty of good funny content that isnt cringe dances public interviews or pranks	neg
damn this is gonna suck for the people who actually get paid for doing tik toks but all the government want is control they could be doing so much other shit then creaming their panties over an app	neg
i love the boomer energy everyone has when they complain about tiktok  as if facebook twitter vines or reddit are any different	pos
i do think it would be funny but i dont like the president it sets for censorship in social media and the internet	neg
id be cool with it  its just bad all around and has bred a whole new type of brain rot	neg
nobody passing this bill gives one fuck about tiktok  this is about control of the internet and will lead to nothing good     well except for the banning of ticktock  but thats only the first sentence of this 200 page bill	neg
not only will this bill allow our government to ban tiktok but it will also give them free reign to ban any app they deem problematic and that is just too much power for the government of a free country to have  fuck this bill	neg
it wouldnt be funny because the government shouldnt be able to do that  and theyre only doing it because meta is paying them to and meta isnt exactly better	neg
so im not alone i think tik tok is stupid and it would be hilarious to watch half of society crumble without it	pos
a tiktok ban is just a bad idea for democracy its weird americas even engaging in something so antifree speech  i dont even use tiktok and i have a huge problem with this	neg
if i couldnt have vine you cant have tiktok  im using my once a lifetime pulling up the ladder on the younger generation card on this thanks	pos
when i heard the news it took me 10 seconds to remember who she was	neg
another cry for attention  i doubt she follows through for long	neg
i love how she says people hate her because shes a fat black woman  girl we hate you bc you sexually exploited your employees	neg
yeah until she has blown through all her money	pos
i only know one of her songs but im surprised how everyone doesnt know who she is so far	pos
whos lizzo	neg
shell be back label it a comeback and preach about how you shouldnt let others keep you down	neg
yea she was dead to me when she was out here fat shaming dancers  umm maam what you hired big dancers made a whole amazon special about it and now you wanna talk bad about them  like you lost weight  she had one song and if you listen to it like 3 times it turns to something you hate  at least it did for me	neg
ya ok   here comes the reality show deal	pos
my favorite part is when she refuses to accept responsibility and becomes a victim	pos
im sure i would recognize a song if i heard it but i certainly cant name one	pos
great cuz i cant fkn stand her voice any time it weasels its way in to my radio	pos
oh that one fat chick that fatshamed her backup dancers  and other shitty things shes done to people	neg
high calorie human bravely quits mediocre singing	pos
arent we supposed to dislike her for mistreating her backup dancers anyways good riddance to shitty people	neg
its not an airport jabba you dont need to announce your departure	neg
booohooo i quit  now gimme attention so i can get enough attention and announce the release of my next single about being hated on    lizzo probably	neg
called out years ago that she was the type of person to use fake body acceptance shes not a good person  ive never met someone with her personality that ive liked	pos
oh miss fatty here is weightshaming her dancers amazing how projection always works its like a right wing politician snatched at a gay bar	pos
acting like i did when i was 12  very funny	pos
if you have any doubts spend 5 seconds on facebook	neg
both my parents still get happy birthday posts on facebook  theyve been dead for 2 and 12 years now	neg
plot twist  op is a bot	neg
insta comment sections when half of them are like so cool   and	pos
had to google what the dead internet theory is  lol definitely not a conspiracy theory anymore  its common knowledge that its at least on some level true	pos
i wish the toxic gaming community people were bots  im looking at you mobas	pos
cyber warfare is real  mass media manipulation from foreign powers is real please be careful online as some people have said yes  this will be happening internally inside countries too	pos
the dead internet theory is an online conspiracy theory that asserts that the internet now consists mainly of bot activity and automatically generated content manipulated by algorithmic curation marginalizing organic human activity to manipulate the population   that explains reddit quite well	neg
especially tiktok comments cant convince me those people who comment there is real	neg
are we the botties	neg
itll be super funny when this is reposted a thousand times by bots	pos
imagine having an argument on reddit and you get a message with your ip address and 3 days later some boston dynamics robot is waiting outside to fuck you up before work  this is the future we designed	neg
im sorry as a generative ai language model i cannot answer this post in a humorous way	pos
the only thing that stops this being true for everyones actual social circles is that most people i interact with can have full convos switch to other apps or meet up  so unless all friends and gamer acquaintances are hyperadvanced robots then im pretty sure were safe so long as we apply some basic checks and common sense  however its fact that the accounts we see identify easily as bots and ignore make up a huge chunk of users	pos
the person below me is a bot  who eats booty	neg
hello is there anybody out there	neg
soon ai generated text will outnumber human generated text on the internet  the dark forest	neg
there are definitely tons of bots in the internet though i doubt the numbers come even close to the number of real people  just an assumption though	pos
lets just find a way to make a virus that hunts and destroys bots    and spam	neg
i fail a lot of captchas  i am questioning my humanity	neg
what if happiness causes boob size	pos
point taken but can we discuss the heresy of mixing skittles and mms god has left this thread	pos
every single person i have met from norway sounds like theyre on the brink of suicide is it all a scam	neg
the vikings only enslaved the ones with big milkers i guess	neg
but what county has the smallest boob size	neg
pretty sure a lot of large cups in the land of freedom too  but they belong to overweight male gamers	pos
aight imma move out  toodles	neg
america actually has the 2nd largest breast size  and probably 1st for males lets be honest	pos
ill need to see some evidence that support those claims	neg
okay and where do i find single twenties girls from norway or iceland	pos
my wife has the third largest boob size in the world    and im happy	pos
pfft  women know that large boobs are uncomfortable and often painful on the back  if were talking larger than ds i doubt theyre happy	neg
the people with back pain would disagree	neg
they both also have the highest retirement age in the world	neg
finland proceeding to be both the happiest and most racist nation in the world for nearly a decade now  always makes me giggle how scandinavia can be some of the least racist and most happy while finland is the complete swap and also happy	pos
makes sense as they are literally the same people  icelanders came from norway and settled there around a 1000 years ago	neg
thats disgusting  people mix skittles and mms	neg
so this confirms that happiness is stored in the boobs	pos
yall are talking like nonboob havers and it shows lmao ask any woman with huge boobs if theyre happy  let me know when they stop ranting about the godawful back pain and issues they bring when theyre too big	pos
the largest breasts can be found in norway iceland the united kingdom and the usa the smallest in central africa and southeast asia world data reported  overall it is striking that increased breast sizes often occur in countries where obesity is also a problem  finland took top honorsfor the fourth year in a rowwith an overall score of 7  842 followed  in order  by denmark  7  620   switzerland  7  571   iceland  7  554   the netherlands  7  464   norway  7  392   and sweden  7  363   biggest boobs but theyre not the happiest countries lol  thats finland and denmark	pos
then you create a forum post and all you get is a bunch of people saying yeah i have this problem too  for the next 3 years	pos
then you ask about it on reddit and the first comment says just google it	neg
as an electrician when i search up questions i have 99  9 of the results is full of shit written for normies	neg
when youre so unique even google thinks youre doing a bit too much	neg
then you finally find an answer and its you from an older post	neg
i once googled how to clean a dusty ceiling and all i got was search results for ceiling fans  google has no idea what i was talking about	pos
linux users gaslight you into think this thats for sure	pos
then you ask an ai and you get a fever dream of an answer	pos
only thing i get is my problem will phrase similarly to another problem and google will only spit out results for that similar problem meaning none of the solutions ever work for me	neg
that is actually better  if you have that problem and no one else had it then that means you are on the verge of discovery	neg
when your google search turns into a no results found horror story	neg
or worse the whole first page are results from the microsoft forums    every post is either completely unhelpful or nvm i fixed it with no information on what they did	neg
exactly	neg
search engines are no longer finding solutions  only spending money	neg
i think part of it is google search results getting far less accurate than they used to be  you could include all the right keywords in your search and still get crappy results bc some companies pay google to put their results up top	neg
the worst is when you google and issue and you come across your own posts from years ago	neg
you know whats worse when you google something and the first result is your own post on reddit from 2 years ago with no comments	neg
wow troubleshooting adventures	pos
when i saw the notification it sounded correct  then i saw the post	neg

kinda wished they kept all the vas from hazbin hotels pilot but their new ones are doing good  most jarring change was husker but you cant beat kieth david	pos
joel heynman will always be caboose	neg
i loved chicken run growing up and they recast both ginger and rocky for the new movie  rocky i understand because it was mel gibson and hes super controversial  julia sawalha who voiced ginger got replaced because she sounded too old and they replaced her with thandie newton who is only 4 years younger than the original  made zero fucking sense	pos
i knew ninjagos cole va passed away but didnt realise it was before crystalised was made so started that season yesterday and instantly recognised it was off  they hired the voice actor of a character from a previous season named morrow which thought was fitting given coles original va name kirby morrow	pos
the voice actress for kirara from inuyasha just died	neg
squidbillies is one of those  unknown hinson went on a hell of a rant about dolly parton and had to get replaced  his voice was just amazing as early cuyler but its understandable	neg
you were real good son real good  maybe even the best rip rick may	pos
i was rewatching naruto and realized zabuza sounded familiar  turns out he also voiced old man joseph  i never really appreciated his work until jojo but damn it still hurts to know hes gone	neg
i mean its not always a reason that should get you cancelled imo  the main va for an anime i enjoyed got replaced cause he cheated on his wife  i mean yeah thats not nice but reason enough to kill his whole career i get it when people get yeeted for actual crimes but cheating is just a dick move not a crime but well when i read about  voice  actors that got replaced cause they are sexual predators for example    fuck those sickos	neg

i work in cybersecurity  1st guy is salesmarketing  second is the technical manager	neg
cybersecurity is more of an industry than a specific job  there are a ton of different roles and there are even people with not a lot of tech knowledge but who help firms perform penetration tests via social engineering  one lady i recall she said her favorite tool to get into buildings is a fake pregnancy belly  people hold open doors for her forgive her for forgetting her badge give her plenty privacy to plant devices for the network hacker  still green team of course   and people just dont see a pregnant lady as a threat  only more reason to have mandatory paid maternity leave	pos
being a schizophrenic narcissist with a drug addiction plotting a revolution does make for a great cybersecurity employee  i just watched an episode from this show lmao   mr  robot for the uninitiated highly _highly_ recommended	pos
i was looking at doing cyber security then i saw the books and decided programming would be a better option	pos

i was at a festival with some friends but in a larger group of people i didnt know  at one point i didnt understand the conversation going on between my friend and these new people  i texted him a question to understand instead of answering he thought my misunderstanding was funny so shared it to the festival group chat  it was pretty embarrassing and was the moment i realised we werent as close as wed previously been	pos

my wife use to do this at family gatherings  her family i have none  and i usually took that as the cue to gtfo and i would make up some excuse that i have a meeting early in the morning and we need to go  its usually someone who never had this happen that questions it anyone else with experience knows whats up and plays it cool	pos
me and my siblings wear good poker faces the rare times we do that its fine  i was at a dudes house hanging out texted him these dudes are weird as fuck   he responded vocally    i dont see that guy anymore	neg

i remember these things that would happen in high school to the kid that was brought along almost as a joke  it was fucked and always pissed me off when i saw it  typically happened because that person was embarrassed to know that kid and was trying to act like dude were not friends like that and trying to make that kid look bad  dont miss those shitty politics of youth    forgot about it even until i saw this post	neg
ay yo julie got a fat ass hey how come you just texted me about julies ass	neg
same energy when you whisper something to your mom during a gathering and she says its rude to whisper say out loud  like mom fuck no it doesnt concern anyone else	neg
what i do is type the message then say hey look at this  and hand them my phone	pos
its even worse when someone tries whispering to you to be discrete  theres nothing discrete about it  it shows everyone else you have something to hide  just text me	neg

had a fight at work like this  dude was mad he couldnt keep up with a discussion we were having  so he started doing some childish shit yelling the same thing over and over when i tried to speak  i was really calm up to this point but he started to get to me so i stood up to leave the room before i lost my temper  as im stepping out the door he says are we done yea you can walk away now and i just fucking lost it  turned back and started screaming at him which of course he used as an excuse to stand up and shove me  which turned into us sort of shovingwrestling each other around the room  somehow at the end of all this i was the bad guy	neg

that was one of my favorite fights between darkseid and superman	pos
i get it but its pointless to let people bait you into acknowledging their behavior  its why marty mcfly was such a good character  he got over that kind of stuff after seeing how a hot shit attitude got him less than spectacular results  folks who are looking for trouble will seek it out through whatever is the most convenient or lucrative means  i mean this in whatever way they get an advantage in life  just learn to think critically and choose your engagements accordingly  some stuff isnt worth arguing especially if someone unknown can record it out of context	pos
you could be the bigger person or you could be the winner	pos

i cant decide if the users of this subreddit are 40 year olds or 9 year olds how do these people dont get the joke its subway surfers in the game you have to run endlessly while being chased by a police officer after making a graffiti thats the joke	neg
graffiti the land with skyscrapers graffiti the sky with aeroplanes and satellites graffiti the minds of children with your man made laws graffiti the world i saw the writing on the wall  we are addicted to planes trains and automobiles we are addicted to addiction we love living in fiction for money power respect the army gotta go kill they under contract so let the blood spill sorta morbid aint it this picture i just painted its an epiphany i had i realize just how tainted our thinking really is while seeing a teenager being arrested for tagging a fucking wall   rehab  graffiti the world	neg

this hits home  i grew up spraypainting the train yard and skatepark  was picked up by the local cops a few times and brought home red handed  eventually i ended up working for the police  if i caught a kid spraypainting      depends on how good it is and where it is  probably take him home and let his parents sort em out	pos
i shot him 37 times  it was a good day	pos
after the acorn incident i wouldnt have been surprised if this was a real thing of a cop assaulting a child for spray painting  instead its subway surfers	neg

this sums up overwatch well there updates mostly are just shameless cash grabs but they know how to do an april fools update	neg
this happening for one main reason the average update only can contain what the whole company allow  in the april fools update can contain anything what the programmers hearth desire	pos
april fools updates planned out a year in advance and collectively added onto as time goes on regular updates we put two potatoes together last night sorry we cant fix anything were too busy	neg
overwatch 2 best patch nots	pos
minecraft fits this perfectly  they do fuck all for 5 years for the actual game adding very niche minor updates  but every april fools they add dimensions new mobs bosses new mechanics and items and more	neg
this is why i hate april fools so much the vast majority of pranks are either fake announcements that one would want to be true  or its something extremely boring  there are a few outliers but the two mentioned above really make up the majority of the april fools experience	neg
meanwhile landfall studios heres a completely new game for free with tons of content thats genuinely fun and easily beats most current aaa games    as a joke btw	pos
hey fake it until you make it	neg
obviously minecraft but which other games too	neg

being an avid witcher book fan    yeeeeep	pos
yeah but when there is 14 books of material to draw upon cough wheel of time cough why do they feel the need to completely rewrite the story	pos
how to train your dragon books are absolutely nothing like the movies plot wise  toothless is probably the size of a melon astrid doesnt exist though there is a similar character named kamikazi who obviously needed a name change fish legs is hiccups cousin and so is snotlout and every viking has two dragons a riding dragon and a hunting dragon  yeah there was already peace between dragons and humans hiccup had to train a particularly stubborn dragon so thats where the book got its name  the movies and the books share the same spirit however and that might be why they are both beloved by fans of both	pos
i remember the movie i robot which is the opposite of the books	neg
as someone who watched the ready player one movie and read the book the movie was kinda shit  like i understand a lot of the really cool stuff in the book couldnt be included because no shit  ex the multiple hours long intense arcade playing sessions wade does as part of the story  but the movie still was not as good  one of the most annoying things was with the extra fucking life in the book wade had to play a perfect game of pacman in the movie he made a bet and was given it basically for free	pos
i mean yeah not saying theres anything wrong with it but visual mediums do tend to bastardize source material	neg
is this from logan	neg
eragon like i know the books arent that amazing but they hold a special place in my heart for getting me into fantasy and reading in general  but holy shit did the movie utterly massacre the first book it was beyond atrocious and saphira  that movies version of her is the one that comes up most often if you look up images of her so much of the fanart uses the god awful movie depiction thats nothing like how the book describes her	neg
i have to admit i hated the ready player one movie the book was so good really took me back to my childhood  the movie was more of an updated version to apply to now there was no real sense of the nostalgia that the book had its was so disappointing for me personally	neg
wheel of time    ravaged	neg
sometimes they improve it  not always the case though  i love stephen kings reaction to the movie the mist  he was upset at how much better the movie ending was than his book	pos
book people on anime all of it happened but why is there more	neg
does anyone know which show or movie the meme is taken from	neg
marvel civil war  the books were far more nuanced the movie had steve objectively in the wrong for protecting bucky and arguably wrong for opposing the accords  civil war 2 was a shitshow though  i dont think anyone would argue in favour of captain marvel	neg
no country for old men am i a joke to you	neg
cloudy with a chance of meatballs film adaption is in a different genre compared to the original book	pos
phoenix saga still hurts	neg
thats because books can spend hours dwelling over all this extra stuff that might be interesting if you made it into 3x 4 hours long movies but in a single watchable movie generally not	pos
this is why i made it a point to wait until after i see the movieshow before reading the book ever since the lord of the rings the two towers  i got sick of watching movies and not being able to enjoy them because all i could focus on were the things that were changed or cut out compared to the book	neg
the sad part is i dont remember the last time	neg

ive seen stuff like this before and thought as a dad i would still pick up my daughter as long as humanly possible  less for purely sentimental reasons but more so like if shes in college and something like this comes up she can be like my dad picked me up when i was home last week	pos

power rangers ripped off voltron	neg
i remember traveling through the paris airport and hearing two british girls fawning over a french translation of the three musketeers in the airport bookstore  its not a uniquely american problem	pos
god this is what the franchise fever has done to us everybody forget what genres are much less the books that invented and defined them	pos
im just waiting for the same group of people to tell me that 40k ripped off drop pods from helldivers	neg
i dont know much about dune but calling it a cash grab is disingenuous imo  last movie was like 40 years ago and the book was 60 years ago  its not like dune was some hot ip they wanted to flip for a quick buck  and they also seemed to actually put a lot of care into it and made 2 really well liked movies  imo if youre gonna try and do an old sci fi story then this is closer to the goal we should all want and not a cash grab  if we wanna talk cash grab we should talk about all the live action anime remakes theyre about to make lol	pos
blasphemy  everyone knows star wars as well as dune plagiarized spaceballs	neg
every fictional story ever told in history was inspired by something else seen and heard before	pos
the irony here is that star wars today is a cash grab of star wars	neg
man whatever the case lets just enjoy both being so good at what they are	pos
they both stole it from buck rogers and flash gordon before hand  they stole from john carter before that  they stole it from h  g  wells and jules verne before      thousands of years of literary theft later   who stole from the epic of gilgamesh	pos
dune inspired star wars   ever wonder where spice in star wars came from	neg
whilst yes dune came first they wouldnt exactly be wrong to say that star wars has reached a pretty insurmountable peak of popularity for sci fi  luke skywalker and the force are a cultural touchstone  paul atreides and spice most certainly are not	pos
literally no one has ever said this	neg
watch kurosawas hidden fortress  1958  and then star wars  you would be in for a surprise	neg
dune pt2 literally pisses on any recent star wars movie  and i say this as a star wars fan	neg
i watched dune the other day  it was one of the best movies ive watched in a long time  star wars is over	pos

wheres the fun in that  hell we have a section of town where the tax is 10  special tax for the development  but if you drive across town you pay 8  35 or you can drive for 20 minutes and pay no tax on food if you shop out of town limits	neg
they also have to do their own taxes  feels like a calculator manufactorer conspiracy to me tbh	neg
my state doesnt have any tax on goods like that  if the tag says 3  99 thats what we pay	pos
its hilarious as a european travelling to the u  s  you just end up initially feeling like youre being scammed until someone explains your weird system to us	pos
hey american folks the joke is that the rest of the world just has all the costs you need to pay included in the sticker price  by law  theres never any confusion over what to pay if it costs 10 its 10  no calculators or difference between states and what not	pos
some of us know what the final price will be but usually not as the tax rate is different in each state county and city  if its a large city it can be different by district	neg
i read people losing their minds over either 8 or 10 tax  meanwhile in the netherlands im crying in 21 tax	neg
this is the way in canada too by the way	neg
the sales tax in our state is roughly 10 so i just keep a tally in my head or on my phone  i truly wish they would just add it in to the sticker price there really isnt a reason not to other than it makes the goods seem cheaper than they are	pos
we just expect the final price to be higher than whats on the price tag  except at the gas pump  somehow they manage to include all taxes there	neg
taxes aside i just hate the whole 19  99 bs like just say its 20 dollars ffs  calling it 19 dollars and 99 cents does not make me believe its cheaper than 20 dollars and doesnt make me want to buy it any more or less than i already do	neg
exact price no  a close approximation because i know how math works yes	pos
__americans are stupid and dont know math  __ nonamericans complaining having to figure sales tax	neg
i always found it ironic considering we were the same people who got mad about the british government taxing us and made a big deal about it	neg
believe it or not  this is the least offensive feature of our tax system	pos
this is great im from america and this is a thought that i feel like a lot of people have had but never say a word about it    because getting to the counter at the corner store and hoping you got enough  and then two people get behind you in line and cashier rings you up n then that tax hit you for an extra  36 cents and make you go running back out to ya car for change under the seat n shit  tax be getting mfs  running back out to my car bc i had no clue what the actual price was until i looked stupid	neg
its the same in canada  they dont include the tax because the final price would discourage potential customers	neg
america is the land of hidden costs  taxes fee tips all to obfuscate the actual price paid  this is what innovation in marketing has done to people  most will see something priced 28  95 and say  its only 20 dollars	pos
rule of thumb is that you always earn less than they say you will and pay more than they say you will	neg
yeah its so we know which local taxes we are hit with so we know what to complain about  in major cities buying jewelry or alcohol can have like 4 lines of local or state taxes	pos

i spent much of my childhood in a place where stray dogs rule the streets  peru   most of my adult life in the us and have attended these bbqs  nothing against dogs in general but most of your babies dont behave much differently than feral street dogs and you arent the amazing dog trainersowners you think you are  i can teach a street dog to sit and roll over for food too  its how you socialize them that matters and thats where most dog owners fall short	neg

the woman i do graphic design for owns three dogs  this isnt her  she would never ever write such a thing  she would just invade the barbecue and let them run wild  and run all over everyone  i refuse to go to her house anymore and havent told her why  they are her children  they are the worst trained children i have ever met	neg

i cannot imagine bringing my dogs to a party where i hope to relax  id constantly be looking to see if they were getting into something being fed scraps thatll fuck up their stomach etc	pos
or its the opposite and the dogs are scared all the time and the owners keep forcing them to socialize when they clearly dont want to	neg
went for a run at a park someone dog started running after me  not aggressively wanting to play  it was an on leash only park because its primarily a wildlife management area it just has a decent trail around it for runningwalking  i wasnt about to interrupt my run for them though so fuck em they can chase down their dog that should have been on a leash ive got a pace i need to maintain	neg
ill never understand why people would bring something that would use the party area as a bathroom  that includes kids and dogs  unless the host asks for my dog my boy stays at home	neg
honestly the joke is always crazy cat people yet i always see dog bumper stickers and my kid has four paws and all this other dog stuff out there  its almost like there are more crazy dog people than crazy cat people	pos
listen i like dogs  i dont have one rn  but since living in a dog building ive realized dog owners dont realize how bad their dogs smell  i literally borderline pass out from the smell  and its not just one dog there are many filthy ones  its so so bad  ive started installing air wicks in the elevator with my own money just to stay alive  bathe your fucking dogs	pos
dude   this chick i know wanted to come over but only if she brought her dogs  i was desperate and still said no  i know her untrained wild dogs  they run around and shit and piss everywhere because she sucks at owning them  constantly getting out into the neighborhood  id be so embarrassed to post about my missing dogs on fb every week	neg

professional dental cleanings and care might seem like a lot upfront especially if youre paying out of pocket but considering the cost of dental issues down the line its an investment in your health that truly pays off	pos
im usually a cheapskate but experience has taught me that some things are worth spending money on  for example 1  car wash vacuum cleaners  so worth it to spend 1  50 or whatever to use one rather than trying to use your own vacuum cleaner  and they get your car cleaner much faster than dragging out your home vacuum to try to clean your car with  2  electronics  buy them new from brand name shops  it isnt worth hassling to save 10 somewhere and getting something that doesnt work or doesnt have a reasonable return policy  3  household help  if you can afford it get someone to come in and clean your house on a regular basis  so it stays    always clean without you having to do anything  4  education  now this is a big one and far more could be written about it  obviously not all education expense is worthwhile so im not necessarily referring to a college degree or whatnot  but educating yourself  or especially educating kids if you have them can return dividends throughout their life	pos

i worked at alta sciences for a while  a preclinical testing facility  they tested the safe dosages of meds before human trials on rats mice dogs etc  they like to say they do the best for the animals as the necessary evil sorta situation but the place is fucking abysmal  painting over mold and literal shit mold in ceilings never fixing any machines and just expecting people to make it work hiding bad procedures from visitors not firing people who straight up kick the animals because they are leads  taking away perks because higher ups made stupid decisions and we payed for it  iacuc fda usda also are basically useless as well since we got enough heads up to scramble a spit shine on the place  the stuff i reported only one change happened and that was cleaning the chemical barrel room  also trying to report these things is a pain in the ass on top of it  any actual fixes are the most half assed fixes made by someone who is not qualified in the slightest so its just gonna break again  there are people who genuinely want to do good by the animals and help push research to help people but corporate greed combined with burnout makes for a bad time  also the pay sucks	neg

hyper aware of their surroundings and able to adapt andor problem solve with lighting speed in abnormal chaos but normal day inconveniences can be a breaking point	neg
therapist checking in here  a more subtle one is that they are hyper aware of their surroundings and peoples emotions  as that was a tool of safety that tends to not be able to be shut off as they become an adult  edit yes this can also be true for people that were in an abusive relationship	pos
apologize for everything that isnt your fault  take blame for events around you that dont involve you  do everything you can to minimize emotional outbursts of others  its not great	neg
they tend to be very independent and have backup plans for their backup plans  it comes from a living environment that was unstable where they were often left to rely upon themselves to get by  and others have pointed out this independence can also manifest as a desire to be in control    because you do not want to be subject to the ambiguity and unreliability of others	neg
me and a roommate were having a disagreement in the kitchen and i absentmindedly reached into a cabinet above for a plate to make a sandwhich  the roommate flinched as i reached up  so that	neg
this is based on my own personal experience mostly but easily scared  startled hiding food  over eating going completely silent when someone yells at you or scolds you excessive apologizing for every little thing that goes wrong being pretty independent and not asking for help because you dont want to bother anyone seeking constant assurance or validation either being incredibly affectionate or not affectionate at all	pos

being hypersensitive as intune with your emotions  and everything else people have mentioned so far   i know exactly how my partners have felt even if they did want not to admit that to me or talk about it even  later when we did talk about they would be incredulous or annoyed about how i knew what was in their heads  i just told them when you spent your first 18 years constantly gauging your mothers emotions to see if it was safe for you that sense is just always on	pos
stressful distressing or intense situation are often a 5 where to others its a 1011  growing up in a violent andor abusive environment hardens you as much as it damages you	neg
they strongly dislike constructive criticism because they are used to people being overly critical of them  they get angry or frustrated over small mistakes	neg
they dont cry about much  take emotional ownership for others even when theres no need  example telling your boss you cant be somewhere  you assume their anger or disappointment  you know peoples emotions in an instant  you plan everything to avoid errors  and are anxious anyway  eta not sharing hobbies or that youre doing something that isnt work or housework  im not afraid to garden but playing a video game while anyone is at home makes me nervous  both are equally fun for me but one is work and the other is play	pos
having a startle response when someone reaches out to touch you even just on the shoulder  having lifelong issues dealing with authority  having lifelong anger issues due to having to suppress feelings because of fear of punishment for actually expressing said feelings  having a long list of things not to do as a parent in spite of ones best efforts inflicting some of those behaviors on ones children anyway  lifelong issues with being socially inept  yes theres been therapy  ptsd in saying the word no in any context due to being beaten as a child for using that word  and so on  seeing all your responses has validated my feelings and helped me to realize im not alone in this  thank you  love and light to all of us	neg

the hospital i was doing renovations at hired an engineer to calculate how many years it would take for the steam lines to cool down enough for them to demo  they didnt like the answer they got so they lied about the numbers to another engineer who gave them a better calculation  during the renovation the demo company went out of business so the general contractor asked us to demo the old steam line  things were great for around 2 hours until the deeply buried steam pushed enough of the water head up enough that it could start making decent progress to the surface we reported that something was wrong but the hospital maintenance team essentially told us to go fuck ourselves and eventually 1  5 hours later the water started working its way out  we were hauling hundred gallon barrels of water out of the building two at a time while the water kept coming out faster and hotter  by the time we were able to get a cap that could fit around the pipe high pressure steam was coming out strong enough that it wasnt visible for a good 1  75 from the pipe  in laymans terms it was hot enough to instantly strip the flesh off your bone and almost hot enough to instantly burn through your bones  there was no capping that pipe  so sure enough thousands of gallons of very old oily and filthy steam flooded the hospital dozens of people died due to infections and unsanitary conditions mostly people who were too critical of condition to move  there was an attempt to sue us then the engineer but it was very quickly proven that everything was caused by gross negligence on the hospitals part and was promptly swept under the rug  its painful looking back on it with hind site if i knew what i did now i would have kicked down the maintenance office door and beat the shit out of those two faced assholes before taking a cap that they had on hand a good 1  5 hours before it was too late to do anything and dozens of people including children would still be alive  i know its not my fault i know that i did everything i could have done with the knowledge i had at the time and i saved a person from getting badly hurt or possibly killed but there was so much time and so many things that so many people did wrong any one of them doing one thing better and the whole nightmare would have never happened	neg

ayahuasca is especially hard to believe  the root of one plant is a source of dimethyl tryptamine a powerful hallucinogen that is also produced by the brain under certain conditions  drinking dmt though will not work  the body has enzymes that break dmt down when it is ingested  a completely unrelated plant has leaves that contain a compound that acts as an maoi  it inhibits the enzyme that breaks down dmt  consuming each plant on their own does nothing but consuming both together results in a powerful psychedelic experience and is a part of the religion of the natives  this is in the amazon rainforest where there is a mindboggling diversity of plants and animals  those two plants together are the only ones that would work to produce ayahuasca  apparently when asked the natives say the plants taught them how to do this	pos

if they dont love music   this is my life  my husband doesnt care for music  i love music  but thankfully he doesnt care if i play it all the time  he just tunes it out  the ironic thing is my husband has a beautiful singing voice and a very strange ability to pick up sequences of notes he hears in anything and link it to a piece of classical music hes heard once or twice as a very small kid  he can recall song lyrics perfectly and replicate the tunes and shit perfectly after hearing a song once or twice  and im pretty sure he has perfect pitch but he doesnt care enough to test it  all things utterly wasted on him  i can barely carry a tune in a bucket and i adore music  ive played multiple instruments and can read music and have been in multiple choirs and making music is insanely difficult for me  it just isnt fair	pos

i was a heavy smoker for 15 years  quit cold turkey  never was addicted to porn  i kicked a cocaine habit  being a high functioning alcoholic is probably something ill never be able to beat  trying to quit drinking hurts me physically and mentally so badly and it doesnt really affect my life right now so i justify not putting myself through it  i know i am shortening my life by not quitting but i still just cant do it	neg

fentanyl  period  i spent 4 years doing it everyday  starting with a half a pill and ending at around 1012 pills a day  i needed it every 23 hours other it felt like death was looming over my shoulder or the sky was going to fall  then after actually quitting i was completely incapacitated for nearly 2 months  couldnt walk eat or drink could only lay in bed 3 feet from the bathroom door and most of the time i couldnt make it in time because i was so weak  i thought after that phase itd be easy   then i realized i had to relearn how to walk socialize stand up and even breathe  normal things you would do from day to day was exceedingly hard  id use all of my energy for the day getting up and getting food out of the kitchen or stepping outside for fresh air then complete exhaustion for the rest of the day like i ran a marathon  i seriously think i couldve been in a completely disabling car crash and recovered easier  i spared a lot of details   but fentanyl has my vote  past 6 months now still not even close to 100  but getting a little better everyday  you couldnt pay me millions to go back	neg

thats a tough question to answer and i think to a certain extent its person specific  for example ive struggled w cigarettes most of my life but my wife doesnt  im clean now but i know if i have even one ill be back up to a pack a day in no time  on the other hand my wife struggles w alcohol addiction whereas i went cold turkey from drinking a handle of whiskey a week without much issue  just based on physiological response probably alcohol or heroine as ive heard cessation both can kill you if youre too dependent  however things like cigarettesalcohol can be harder in a way because theyre more ubiquitous in society advertised openly and plenty of people use them without ruining their lives  i hate to say it but you can probably include many prescription pills in that category nowadays	neg

might get flamed for this but self harm  for drugs yes the urge is always there but theres no way to do it and not feel like you relapsed  but self harm instead of cutting you make the water during your shower too hot or bump into things totally not on purpose so you get bruises that hurt or you fall a lot or you scratch at your arm or you accidentally hit yourself randomly  self harm as far as im aware is really the only addiction where youre relapsing but can pass it as not relapsing just because youre not doing what you used to  its like you have all these cheat codes and especially when the marks that prove you did it once fade it makes you want to do it all over again and i dont think theres anything like that with drugs	neg
not my story but a buddy of mine who was a selfemployed welder  he would do calls mostly to ranches barns and other rural and livestock type usually repairing gates corrals and equipment  anyhow he showed up one day at a stable for 4h kids and was gonna fix some fencing for the paddock  the lady who ran the stables mentioned her husband was out of town picking up a horse they bought  long story short she invited him inside to cool off  this is 102 degree texas weather so anyone would naturally take the offer  she gave him a tall glass of tea water and some fruit to cool off while she went to change  within a couple minutes she came down the stairs in just panties and asked if he wanted to take a nice cool shower  he told me it was really hard to say no but he declined only because he had been cheated on before and never wanted another man to feel that pain  edit since a couple people asked 4h is a program across the u  s  that helps kids and teenagers with development skills in science agriculture community outreach and various other programs  in this case the 4h club was agriculture  so they learn how to ride horses care for them feed them brush them etc	pos

i delivered pizzas for a local mom and pop pizza shop  more than 30 years ago   there was one house that would call in orders and the other drivers would openly argue over whose turn it was to deliver to this address  being the new guy on the crew i never got the chance nor would they tell me what the deal was so my imagination ran wild  well one day the stars aligned and i finally got the opportunity  to my disappointment it turned out that the deal was that it was an older gentleman who lived alone and offered a hundred dollar tip for you to watch porn and jerk off while he watched  tldr  easiest 100 i ever made	neg

i have absolutely no desire to be immortal fuck that	neg
i wouldnt want to do that  im scared of the person i would end up becoming by outliving everyone i ever care about and having to do it over and over again with each person i meet  i feel like i would stop valuing human life and i would become a monster who views people as toys to amuse myself  my concept of time would also be warped due to it no longer being something i care about either  im happy with the life that i have now and id rather make the most of the time i have rather than be immortal and have all the time in the world	pos

im honestly not sure im strong enough to deal with everyone around me dying over and over  i am a pretty empathetic person and i imagine at some point you lose the ability to form that sort of emotional bond  i find the movie the man from earth  and its sequel  to be fascinating but one of the things that struck me is that the main character who has been alive since cave men were a thing has a very hard time forming love bonds  hes seen everyone he cared about die so many times over that hes just moved past that emotional experience  i dont know if i could handle that to be honest  also not sure id want to live through millennia of being oppressed and confined to the kitchen before being able to live as an equal to men  i really like my life and would intellectually love to see society develop over time like that  am currently an academic   but its a lot harder to do academic study in early universities if youre female as i am  pretty sure id be burned as a witch fairly quickly so i hope immortality includes being able to heal quickly after injury or something	pos
im not sure the 3000 years is significant  if you were made immortal today eventually this date would be 3000 years in the past  does time have any importance to an immortal and this is ignoring the usual questions regarding invulnerability aging vs nonaging etc	pos
not sure it would be all that fun as youd be roughing it comparatively to what were used to for a good 2950 of those years	pos
you really cant do it  youd need incredibly specific conditions  if its just the no aging immortality good luck surviving for thousands of years  youre probably gonna be put in a forest next to a bear or some shit and die right away anyways  or youll trip over something trying to get out of the forest cut your leg and die of infection  or youll starve to death because you dont know where you are and arent a wilderness man  if its the invincible cant die immortality then hooooooooly shit  gonna be a fun run  lets say humanity gets off earth and you dont sit here until the sun expands and engulfs the planet  so youre not burning inside of the sun for billions of years  maybe you tour the galaxy great time much fun  youre galactic god emperor  way to go  what an accomplishment i mean boy howdy  how could it go wrong from here well after a few billion years the andromeda galaxy collides with the milky way and your empire is toast  oh well its been a fun run  so whats next good question well its 10100 years of suffering  waiting for the heat death of the universe  does that kill you probably not because you are pure magic  protons have decayed  there is no universe  just you  in empty abandon  forever  its the worst possible thing that can be imagined	neg

meth  it can take the kindest person in the world and turn them into a monster  i know because i was said monster when i was hooked on it  no drug is harsher on the body than meth and the way it destroys the dopamine receptors in your brain is horrifying  ive been sober for 1  5 years and i know i will never experience pleasure the same way again  honorable mentions datura fentanyl krokodil xylazine bath salts	neg

datura  its a fucking deliriant and highly poisonous so stay the hell away from it  i made the mistake of trusting an old friend who told me the trip would be mild and it really did start off pretty chill  i guess i took to much though  i got talking to this gal on the couch and we were really hitting it off so we started kissing after a bit  it turns out she was a snake in sheeps clothing  well a blanket to be exact  i was kissing a fucking blanket in front of the party  ive got the hunger that only betrayal and sadness can cause so i decided i needed bowl of cereal  as im sitting on a stool and talking to what i hope was real people i lose my balance and tip backwards  i ended up breaking through the window and partially dangling there face covered in sugary milk while some people are trying to pull me back into the house  time has lost all meaning at this point  people are there  people are gone  im lost in my own house wondering around trying to find that lying blanket of a whore when i pass by the bathroom and i catch a glimpse of her  i spring into the room trying to surprise her when i realize that what i saw was a towel hanging up  shes crafty and skilled at hiding  part of my somewhat functional brain remembers i have to work so i manage to escape the labyrinth that was my two bedroom house and attempt to get there  the problem was my car was invisible  im starting to think the blankettowellady is also invisible  guess i have to walk to work  not sure how im going to get there considering a block into my walk i am now in a different town i grew up in  someone called in my stupid lost ass to the cops  i was playing hopscotch on the sidewalk during a midwest winter wearing only my shorts and a shirt while covered in my own blood when multiple patrol cars pulled up  they were asking me questions but the majority of my responses apparently werent intelligible as i was speaking like boomhauer from king of the hill  i also couldnt focus because the shriners were in town and driving their silly little cars around us  only i could see them which was a nice change of pace from shit hiding from me  then i grew a tail and did as all would do and started chasing it in circles while the shriners drove around us and the cops were left most likely questioning their life choices that led them to this point  they then inform me that i need to be treated at the hospital but i declined because i didnt have insurance  they said the alternative was jail so i accepted the ambulance ride strapped down to a gurney for my safety  once at the hospital im given drug tests of which i found out later i only tested positive for weed an mri and spent the next few days in icu until i was stable  i remember my mom showing up and she brought me a blt for a snack  i try to grab it to take a bite but it was actually her hand  during the rest of my time at the hospital the hallucinations were far more tame since i was coming down  brown cats were actually brown napkins black puppies running past my doorway were actually black wheels of a cart and there werent actually mice on top of my tv  i hope  i ended up suffering a tbi to my frontal lobe from repeatedly slamming my dome into a solid door to break it down after being locked in my room several lacerations to my head and body from the window and taking a spill down the stairs tens of thousands in medical debt having to relearn to read since words were beyond jumbled for awhile after and one fucking stupid experience to share whenever this question gets asked  there is a reason why so many hard drug users would never willingly touch this stuff	neg

most damage all time alcohol  goat for ruined lives since ancient times	neg
crack is fucking stupid  it gets you super high for 5 seconds then the worst withdrawals ever right after  you just end up smoking more crack to keep the withdrawals away  you unironically would have a better time doing meth or keyboard cleaner	neg
carfentanyl  dangerous opioids are 10000 times more potent than morphine and 100 times more potent than fentanyl	neg
krokodil and xylazine combined with heroin are both fairly screwed up	neg
krokodil it was like heroin but with gasoline in it really only found in russia  it caused your skin to turn green and then rot off  i dont think its around anymore because fentanyl is cheaper and it was just a drug for people too poor for heroin	neg
im a police officer and i would 100 say alcohol  no other drug comes near to as being so destructive to society  i would say 80 of domestic incidents i go to involves alcohol and the vast majority of domestic abuse is fuelled by alcohol  families cant go out in the evening of their local towncity because they dont feel safe from all the drunken idiot who are fighting and not to mention other offences such as driving over the prescribed limit  i enjoy a drink as much as the next person  but i dont think your average person understands how many of societies problems are caused by alcohol  im confident if alcohol was discovered today rather than 1000s of years ago  it would be banned everywhere	neg
krokodil or that angels trumpet or whatever  turning people into mindless zombies edit spelling error	neg
synthetic marijuana aka spice aka k2 its something thats more destructive then crack heroin and meth  its beyond worse  watch some prison videos on them guys getting high  all those guys arent chilling high feeling good  their all in a warped reality of pure hell and their bodys are physically being manipulated by the stuff thats causing them to suffer and smother  and it causes someone to be so petrified with what seems no way out  they can look at someone they known their whole life and attack them and try to kill them cause they are that far out of it mentally  its scary  and next to impossible to quit	neg
two things  1  when he called the cave rescuer a pedophile and doubled down on it after lying about sending a rescue minisub  2  during the height of covid he claimed he was retrofitting his production and said he sent 1000 ventilators to desperate us hospitals  he actually sent a few useless and cheap outsourced cpap machines  for sleep apnea   he never did send a single ventilator	neg
honestly my shift in perspective came when i noticed the pattern of him using controversy to stay relevant  initially his ideas and ambitions for space and clean energy were enthralling  then it became a sequence of erratic tweets controversial stances and haphazard business moves that seemed more about stirring the media pot than true innovation  the thai cave fiasco as mentioned was an eyeopener but what sealed it for me was the entire fiasco with the twitter acquisition  its one thing to be an eccentric genius its another to wield influence without a compass	neg
the first time i realized theres something wrong with him was when he accused one of the mine divers of being a pedophile because he was mad at him  it was all downhill from there	neg
that whole thing with the kids trapped in the cave in thailand where musk tried to insert himself as the hero  when the prodivers actually rescued the kids and nobody took musks minisubmarine idea seriously and then he goes and calls the leader of the rescue team a pedophile it really revealed a lot about his character to me  hes got an ego the size of the sun the maturity of a 12 year old and the selfawareness of a brick	pos
thai cave thing is when it started  but then it continued with each and every time he opened his stupid mouth about stuff he clearly had no idea about  hes not a futurist hes just another reactionary who wishes he could be a 19th century robber baron	neg
it should have been obvious after the thai cave thing but i didnt follow that story all that closely  the very first time i personally started to have questions was when he proposed an underground hyperloop for rt 1 in delaware  most people have probably forgotten that but im from delaware and have driven on rt 1 many times over my entire life so it caught our attention here  rt 1 gets a crazy traffic in the summer when people are trying to get from points north to the beach resort towns but is otherwise a pretty empty stretch of highway connecting not much to not much  delaware is also basically a sandbar and you only have to dig about 2 feet to hit water  thats an exaggeration in some parts but not by a lot     you dont even want your house to have a basement much less a tunnel running the length of the entire state  so my first reaction was wow that would be awesome on july 4 weekend   and then     but why and then but how and then wait is there a chance this guy actually a complete loon and nobody has caught on yet	pos
quite honestly  the turning point was immediately after i started to like him  as i was starting to like him even  the problem is that once you learn anything about him you realize what a miserable sack of wasted flesh he is  once you start looking into his social media presence the reality becomes literally unavoidable  so i thought hey that musk guy with the solar panels seems like he might be onto something and then one google search later i realized i had been wrong  this was quite a while ago so his personal opinions werent yet plastered everywhere	neg
no single turning point but several things over time  for me the very first moment was when he kept insisting that our world is a simulation based on incredibly flimsy logic and everybody was just like oh yes yes good point mr  musk  like i dont have a strong opinion on the idea but i was sort of turned off by how he had somehow risen above scrutiny at that moment  then came the thai cave rescue incident  i wasnt bothered by him trying to contribute resources to help even if nobody had asked for it  but the false accusation calling his critic a pedo guy iirc and everything that followed in that story was a big issue  then came the cybertruck  that thing is ridiculous on a practical level in so many ways  then came the actions he took immediately after purchasing twitter  a lot of really bad business decisions and really poor treatment of people	pos
i liked him when he was focused on making green energy affordable  i remember when he came out with the tesla solar roof and i thought it was very cool  i still think its a great idea  the turning point for me was when he became more political when he started going down the antiwoke and conspiracy theorist path  i noticed that the type of people that were rallying around him were not the kind of people i like or even agree with  and musk kept doubling down to the point where he bought twitter and lost all that money  it just became extremely obvious that hes very thinskinned and hes the type of person that can never admit hes wrong about anything  then of course he started letting his racism and antisemitism slip out but i was way past my turning point by then	pos
i used to read about him from a far  browsing headlines and reading stories about how hes the next great inventor  that hes like a modern nikola tesla or something  thought he was cool and looked forward to hearing more  as more and more came out its clear hes just a fraud and is loaded rich  rich guy with great pr for a few years  no one moment flipped his script for me  he just isnt what he or anyone else claimed  just a money whale throwing cash at renewable energy because thats the future of the world  its all done though  hes just your usual run of the mill flawed human  not the visionary social media would have led you to believe	pos
when i first started hearing about elon musk it was essentially that he was the genius visionary founder of tesla and i thought wow this guy sounds pretty cool   i dont know anything about electric cars so when he talked about it it all sounded pretty smart  i think the tesla wall and solar roof are really cool ideas  then he was the genius visionary founder of spacex and i thought man he sounds like a modern day thomas edison   i dont know much about space flight so when he talked about it it all sounded pretty smart  then he bought twitter  i do know a bit about software development so when he talked about reimplementing the entire tech stack and disabling microservices to save money i realized that he had no fucking idea what he was talking about  charging a fee so that anyone can get a verified check mark shows a fundamental misunderstanding about the platform  then he just kept talking and talking and my impression of him continued to drop  then i found out that he didnt actually found tesla and doesnt even have a stem background  he still wont shut up  covid the cave rescue thing the woke stuff ukraine	pos
the moment he started talking about ukraine having to submit to russia and be done with it  then jt was further amplified by him randomly shutting down starlink to sabotage ukrainian military operations out of pettiness	neg
my break point was musk making excuses for putin in ukraine	neg

i read his authorized biography about a decade ago  dude is a complete tool who sees people as a resource for his consumption	neg
had to work with him  he was a complete ass and belittled and cussed out an engineer  then he stormed off and flipped his smock like an evil villain	neg

if your goal is making humanity a multi planetary species the cost of twitter would have bought a lot of spaceship development	neg
stuff such as him saying hell donate 6 billion to fight world hunger if the charity actually layed out a comprehensive plan to make it work  they did and then he snuck away never to mention it again    weird bloke  stands for nothing other than his next 100 million	neg
i was a huge elon fanboy  id literally rage about how nyt and wsj would run baseless hit pieces on tesla to protect their relationships with traditional auto manufacturers  i also could not wait to buy a tesla someday  when he started going anti woke during covid i went from fanboy to neutralwhen he started defending russia and saying ukraine should surrender to preserve the global economy i was absolutely done  elon just like pretty much every other insanely rich person in the u  s  is purely motivated by greed and has zero morals  thats very apparent and why i now despise him	pos

when i was maybe 7ish i went to the grocery store with my mother  when she was checking out i went to turn the gumball machine to see if anyone left quarters in there and didnt spin it all the way  well one of them was broken and i spun the sucker until my pockets were full of gumballs  when we got in the car my mother asked what was in my pockets  and i told her nothing  she still knows nothing to this day  she did however say if one of those machines was broken and you just kept turning them thats stealing   i sure fooled her	neg
my dad had a pot pipe made of wood in the garage  i use to smoke out of it all the time because he didnt realize i knew it was there  anyway i didnt have a lighter one day and i used a blow torch in the garage to smoke out of it  completely destroyed the pipe  about 15 years later my dad tells me about how he lost this pipe he made in his shop class in the 70s  ooops	neg
my fiance and partner of almost 8 years broke up with me a few months ago  ive realized i was so emotionally dependent on him that i dont know how to exist as my own person  i have suicidal thoughts sometimes from the stresspain of not being able to be with him  no one really gets it  i genuinely think i will never love anyone as much as i love him and im scared ill end up alone for the rest of my life  edit wow thanks to everyone for leaving such sweet and inspiring comments  i am in an intensive therapy program right now and have told others  including professionals  about the concerning thoughts and am being helped with those  it really does make a difference knowing that so many others have been through the same thing and have made it out ok on the other side  and for some of you even better on the other side	neg
ive lived a boring non secretive life but my great grandfather once told me a story of when he killed a man with a baseball bat for trying to rob the bar that he owned and the regulars of the bar stashed the body somewhere and nobody ever talked about it again  he then put his finger to his mouth and said shh dont tell anyone  so there ya go  sorry gramps  edit this happened in brazil back in the 60s  gramps is long gone  did it really happen i have no idea but it was brazil    something similar to that probably happened during the time it took me to type this edit out  brazil do be like that	neg

in 1996 i was 6 years old and a friend told me that computer mouse balls were worth as much as gold  stupidly and with no plan i stole one from the classroom computer  our teacher got extremely angry and i got really really scared id get caught  he had us all leave the room and go in one by one so that whoever stole it could anonymously put it back  i was too scared that somebody might see so i didnt put it back  he exploded on us  the next day i was going to try to secretly return it but a kid randomly emptily confessed that he was the one who stole it and his mom went to the store to buy a new one  he stood in front of the class with a written apology and everything  i should have taken a stand and said no kyle  you didnt steal it i did  shameful  anyway 28 years later kyle is a stripper at a gay nightclub	neg
live in the only major urban center in a very rural area where theres all kinds of suburbs road construction gravel pits etc  whenever i see heavy equipment that doesnt get moved or is left unattended i sneak into the worksite at night climb in the always unlocked bulldozer or whatever the fuck it is and proceed to lay on the horn in the dead of night before scrambling away  it has been a decade since i started and i think now ive honked the horns of just about every type of heavy machinery that has one	neg
in grade 7 i didnt want to do my book report so i didnt go take out a book from the library  when the project was almost due i had a sudden change of heart because i didnt want to get in trouble from my parents who were extremely strict  it was too late to go to the library to get a book because my teacher would have known and told my parents  so i completely made up a book with a fake title and fake author did my entire book report and even drew a bonus picture to illustrate my favorite part of the book  the teacher told me i would have gotten an a if she was able to find the book in the library when she looked  i acted as if i had no idea where the book had went and i swore up and down that i returned it to the library	neg

circa 2004  in first grade i was your typical gifted kid  since turned burnout of course   i absolutely loved my teacher  one day i arrived to a new face greeting me at the classroom door  this was the first time id ever encountered a substitute teacher  this sub in particular was a mean nasty woman who reeked of cigarettes  within the first hour of class she told me to shut up  i had never been in trouble at school before and those two words broke my little teachers pet heart  yes this is my villain origin story op  i immediately decided to plan my escape  at lunch and recess i grabbed my backpack jacket and rain boots and walked straight out the front door  i still have no idea how a 5 year old could walk out the front doors of a school completely unnoticed  nonetheless there i was  the world was my oyster  i walked straight home singing im going home and nobody can stop me ha ha ha ha ha  to the tune of old macdonald  for 4 kilometres  i had done it  i was home free  when i got there i saw my babysitters car in the driveway  filled with panic i remembered that my little brother had stayed home sick today  terrified of disappointing my babysitter i had to make a decision  return to the bad lady at school or face the wrath of a 20 yearold girl who in all reality would have just been completely stunned i chose the former and bolted up the hill in our town another 4 kilometres in the pouring rain  soaking wet i ran through the side entrance of the school adjacent to the playground put my bag back in my locker and sprinted into my classroom  the substitute stared at me for a second  i thought i was toast  after what felt like forever she barked at me to change out of my rain boots and put on my indoor shoes  i dawned on me that although i must have been gone almost two hours she hadnt even noticed i had left  my first jailbreak and my first coverup story both successful missions  i never told a soul about my rainy day adventure  if youre out there chainsmoker substitute teacher i hope youve found a new career path	pos
i have the type of ocd that makes me think im a pedophile  i have never touched a child and never want to  the thought of it disgusts me  but i get recurring intrusive and very unwanted thoughts about it  when i had my son i almost gave him up for adoption because of the horrendous fear that i would hurt him somehow without realizing  ill look at a little girls hair and go aww how cute   and my brain goes wow look at you clearly a rapist  theres something really wrong with you   i was sexually abused as a child myself so i think it was just a weird way my brain coped with it  to be afraid of causing that pain to someone else so much that every action is a potential sign that i am capable of hurting a child like that  it became extreme and i limited a lot of my life to try and prevent something i wouldnt ever do  i didnt learn it was ocd until well into adulthood  once i realized they were just intrusive thoughts and they didnt define who i was it sort of lost its power over me  but ive only ever told my husband	neg
in 3rd grade i was at a birthday party and just learned the word asshole  i was showing the other kids how to use it in a sentence and called this kid cody an asshole as an example  apparently he told his mom that i called him an asshole and then his mom goes and tells all the other parents and even my 3rd grade teacher i was a foul mouthed kid who called people asshole  it became a whole thing with multiple parent meetings and phone calls for  what felt like  a whole week  the birthday boy freddie finally came forward and vouched for me and said i never called anyone an asshole and that i was the nicest at the party  anyway i feel like i got away scottfree and cody was indeed an asshole snitch	pos
as a teenager in the 90s my house yard was always getting toilet papered and eggd   somehow it was my fault and my parents would be pissed at me and make me clean it up every weekend  i found out the asshole who was doing it and took a big nasty shit in a plastic bag and put it in his mailbox  all the shit stopped immediately after that  not my proudest moment but i think it got my point across	neg
when i was 12yo i saw my dads hand camcorder in their room and i was curious so i tried to play whats on it  holy shit it was a sex video  i was so innocent back then it was my first time seeing stuff like that  but that was not the worst part  the thing was with who i saw on the video  it was my dad fucking other woman and not my mom but our maid  i was so shocked i didnt even know how to process that  then i turned off the cam and went downstairs  after few hours my dad called me and asked if i tinkered his camcorder and of course out of fear i said i did not  he cannot also ask me for more info since he was cheating with other woman  so he let it pass and we never talked about it after that ever again  until now i never told a soul about what i saw that moment  t_t	neg
communicate  ask her what she wants you to do	neg
hey i just want to start by saying that youre doing exactly what you should be doing by realizing you need some guidance here  1  this is trauma for both of you  knowing someone you care for has been violated can be something heavy  please try to remember that youll both need some time and space to process and that these things will not happen overnight or in a linear way  2  as another commenter said try to ask clear questions instead of what can i do try can i get you some water would you like to hold handssit apart do you want to go for a drive a walk have a nap do you want toast or cereal asking these specific questions will give her a chance to take control of her body in small ways  shell need this right now  3  reach out to crisis lines if you need support  they can help you get through tough moments  good luck to you both	pos
great job on actually asking for advice here  seriously  thats an important part of it all as that is very much an exceptional situation  but yes the previous commenter basically cut down to whats important ask her about any sort of touching and similar right now  she knows that you wont assault her or anything like that probably doesnt want to give you a feeling of mistrust but the fact of the matter is this is traumatic and a trauma will influence you period  the holiday is most likely gonna have to be laid back  i get how you feel but that should not be the main concern here  if she wants to go out and you provide her with a feeling of security and safety thats perfectly fine  but if she needs time and peace you need to respect that  as hard as this sounds you dont know what exactly happened and how badly it affected her  there is a chance it was a lot worse than what shes showing right now  my ex was straight up raped a few years ago her mother and i assumed she was just groped for over a year because she didnt want anyone to worry and didnt tell anyone  so again be calm be gentle be easy on her  dont force her to talk but also let her know that if she wants to she can  touching can be a sensitive topic after something like this so make sure shes okay with it  if youre lucky she wants more of that after this has calmed a bit because it lets her be in control of any physical contact sexual or not  if not you have to respect that also  stay strong both of you  this does heal as much as any other mental scar but it takes time	pos
the previous comenters have been great so ill only recomend a youtube by a licenced therapist chanel called  therapy in a nutshell i think some of the stuff can help out in general not for this specifically but i think working on other things and not engauging with the situation itself unless she wants to is probably bettwr for a whille  one thing i will say is for you to try not taking things personally if she takes a longer time or snaps at you or something  assuming she does at all  i wish you two well  youll be alright	pos
dont just ask something like what do you want thats really overwhelming  ask something like do you need space right now can i hugtouch you do you want to tell me whats on your mind or do you want to be distracted from it	pos

reading your guys comments is unreal  when i graduated college just after 2008 i was no shining example of perfection  and i hated every soul sucking minute of full time work  but the key is to find work that doesnt make it painful to experience the passage of time  or have a goal so big the pain is worth it  how else do you think people that work 2 jobs back to back do it  16 hr days 80 hrs weeks  i know a woman who does this with her 3 kids in mind  now thats a mom  she never complains about it either  some want so badly to fund a small business and they need the capitol over time to be successful  you kids are on such a fast path to suicide if you are focused on the short term pain over the long term benefit  how do you reach any goals while suffering over the suffering	neg
this is sarcasm  please tell me this is sarcasm	neg
focused on the short term pain the famously short term of 45 years of full time labor  how else do you think people that work 2 jobs back to back do it the title implicitly wondered about that as well good catch  are you planning on adding anything constructive im not sure if you realize it but your comment reads antagonistically even though this post is specifically asking for encouragement and sympathy	pos
if you want to travel do it today  work just long enough to take a year or two off to go anywhere  the thing thats true now more than ever is there are no assurances  1  you dont know if that place will be there soon  bye bye great barrier reef  2  you dont know if your bodyhealthage will allow it  trips 72 are far less exciting  3  maybe the reason you want to go is lost by the time you finally cab afford to travel 10 years later  that chance to learn something about why you once felt a certain way lost forever  money is almost as dumb to chase as it is seeing men chase women  bc when you get your hands on either you have to work to hold it  wouldnt you rather money chase you or a woman chase you i had a friend who traveled to spain and was pushed  or pulled  into a job that made her far wealthier than in the us  she was in this sort of self realized state of positive charisma  it definitely helped that business group see her potential and desire her in their organization  you can travel economically  far better than you think  take jobs along the way get cozy with locals experience a new way of life  never is this more exciting and sexy than when youre young	pos
where do you think we are this post is a specific post  written on purpose by an individual  looking for a specific thing  this post is looking for support and sympathy  if youre not interesting in having that conversation why are you even here when i graduated college just after 2008 this tells everyone that sees your comment exactly what they need to know  move on	pos
where do i think we are the condescension  were on planet earth together and are the exact same species  meaning the entitled strawman argument you just made u cant understand bc u obviously older thats not a reason to write me off  what you are essentially doing is bringing the 700 pound man on his bed cake everyday  who cant get up to access fridge  that cake or validation you seem to be pushing is the absolute worst advice possible  not only does it not do anything for sadunhappyunfulfilled poster it perpetuates his situation by discouraging actual solutions  encourging others to hide behind their misery like you do yours in disgusting  i come here to understand youth and offer real perspective bc     spoiler  i was there once too  a man doesnt become a man by aging  blind leading the dumb here on reddit	neg
maybe sell something like a video game or a movie i did that a few times for a cab	pos
lmfaooo yeah  i live upstate so from my job to my house i have to take a coach bus  so ive been spending like 40 a day now im maxed out	pos
i dont have any loool  im also not home or near my house	neg
oh fudge  do you have neighbors who need to have small chores done then some elderly people are willing to pay younger neighbors do to stuff for them  or any old person  you can make cash online but it takes a long time	neg
you learn a lot of good tricks to both keep and make money	pos
it sounds to me like youre really wanting to get laid and that youre framing all of the selfimprovement youve done as just a means to that end  have you considered that all of that self improvement could be intrinsically rewarding im wondering if theres something youre trying to get out of sexual encounters that just isnt materializing  maybe once youve identified what youre actually wanting youll be able to identify what you can do to achieve that	pos
bro saying only five women like some people in here arent surely older than you and virgins  maybe you dont get sex coz you complain about being an incel on reddit	neg
when you look in the mirror do you think girls want that if not theres stuff you gotta work on only you know what it is	pos
22f have been on a 2 year long dry spell because dudes like you prioritize getting laid over human connection  women arent mythical fairies who sometimes bless you with coochie were people  just like the homies you play cod with and the homies you go to the gym with  all this manosphere redpill shit is affecting a lot of yall in ways that are turning you against women than being unified with us  sex isnt also onesided  you could easily get with a woman and later find out she felt like she was assaulted because of your unrelenting desperate advances  just continue to work on bettering yourself  not just physically and emotionally but mentally as well  desperation is very obvious to women and men that talk like you often arent self aware enough to realize that  i didnt even need to read the whole post to know what it was about  as a young adult youre often more attractive than you think  i know you said you had a patchy beard short etc but nobody sees those things if you dont make it your entire personality  i could be the chibi kawaii girl everyone initially sees me as but im not because thats not who i imagine myself to be  if you stop focusing on whats on the outside and start doing better with whats inside maybe a woman will want to spend time with you in the day time in public with her location shared and a friend nearby  but as you are currently doing anything for coochie    youre not gonna go anywhere  youre literally being a chameleon just to get some and no sane woman seeking stability wants that	pos
you can make yourself less ugly  sounds like a selfimage issue  start a skincare routine shave your beard regularly if you cant grow a nice one and if you are balding just own it and shave your head it will look way way better than bringing attention to the bald spot with hair  my dad went bald at 19 and rocked a shaved head the rest of his life and he was a good looking dude  the jawline stuff is not as big a deal as the internet wants you to believe  buy some clothes that make you feel good about your looks stay on top of your hygiene and keep at the gym and the confidence  and romantic partners  will come with time	pos
ever work on your rizz though	neg
didnt read all that because alcohol but the idea of clubs doesnt stop once school does  go join things that are social  library community centre the six apps that help with this go with the intention of simply participating in these events  say yes to going to a bar after  youll have sex far sooner than you may expect  and only then will you realize that the sex was actually the second best thing you gained by doing this	pos
its normal for a 23yr old guy  dont listen to anything reddit says regarding this i promise you that their sex lived are worse than yours	neg
project confidence	pos
same age virgin never had a relationship  dont give yourself a hard time  a lot of people struggle with this sort of thing especially in such a digital age where people arent meeting or approaching people the way they did in the past  i know its frustrating but youre not alone	neg
its not about the looks    its about the rizz  seriously  second note i think youve gaslit yourself because i am not in any serious relationship with any of my sexual partners  relationships really dont matter	neg
im actually not into the sex per say  i want a relationship  i want someone to love and hold onto	pos
no but it will get it off his mind allowing him to focus on others things if hes the type to dwell	pos
are you even looking for advice because half the things you listed about your appearance you cant change  pretty sure this is just one person mega bored out of their mind repeating the same post over and over again  i mostly lurk here and ive seen this post with a slightly different twist loads of times  its always a guy who says he has an unsatisfactory amount of sexual partners or whatever  hes always weirdly obsessed with describing it in numbers  then he follows it up with saying hes already followed the generic advice people give to desperate  unsuccessful dudes like himself  finally he finishes it off saying that generic advice doesnt work because hes bald  ing   short lacks facial hair has no jawline andor is just plain ugly  or a combination of these factors  i dont know what hes trying to aim for here  he acts like hes open for feedback but hell dismiss it all by saying hes ugly or any of the things i just listed  this profile is brand new which says enough	neg
idk why you were downvoted but youll get there homie	neg
then perhaps you could start trying to connect with people in hobbycommunities that are important to you  it doesnt have to be with any pretense just participate  eventually you may find someone who shares those same needs	pos
fuck your mom from the bottom of my heart  no offense to you but someone asking that from anyone especially their own kid has no self regulation  seriously that is fucking horrible  there is no good reason for that not even if she wants to teach you a lesson or some crap  unless there is a genuine reason along the lines of she loaned you 10 grand a few months ago there is nothing okay about this  buy a van or wagon and live in that for a while until you find an affordable place  anything to get out of where you are  if you cant afford that because of what you pay her any chance you can stay at a friends place for a month a thousand bucks would be enough to get you something two would be enough for something good  i lived in a wagon for a good while from experience a van to stand up in is much nicer as a longer term thing  a wagon is nice to sleep and work in but in terms of actually treating it as a sort of house a van is nicer  minivan with foldable or removable rear seats works too	pos
im sure youve already thought of this but moving out is your best bet  also id bring this up when retirement home talks come up but im just petty  depending on where you live see if public transport is an option  also again depending on where you liven it sounds like you travel frequently so id try to get an alternative to uber since thats just burning your money  car is the most obvious but most expensive but look into ebikes  i got one for my first 2 years of college for like 130 at walmart   saving should be easy  aside from the chunk your mom takes  if you have no other expenses  also does she not allow you to eat food she buys or is that responsibility all on you if shes feeling reasonable you could also ask if you can exchange household tasks for a lower fee  cleaning cooking fixing things etc   but if she asked this idk  good luck to you  regardless its gonna be a waiting game cause 1300 a month wouldnt really get you a rental anywhere anytime soon	pos
why does she want that money from you	pos
yo im not the only one mt dad makes me pay 300 a week  aud  to live with him and his partner    not to say either is a good situation to be in but someone finally can relate to how shit it is	neg
start looking at studio apartments just so you know where the good ones are when the time comes  it will come to a point that youll lose patience and want to move out and youll save money on that move if you have a plan in place  this happened to me and they werent even charging me  also consider      the r word  roommate  i know but its better than it sounds	pos
where do you work	neg
just pay a bill or two and start working fulltime so you bring in more each month  youll be out of the house more and she wont complain about you not contributing	pos
i mean if you come over to my country ill marry you life here is very cheap wont even have to move we got those 50 buck a month servants	neg
i get charging your kids rent isnt ok but i dont think shes terrible for it  if thats all she asks especially if he doesnt have to buy his own food and all the other stuff and if she wouldnt kick him out if he couldnt pay it then its reasonable  unless she makes enough money that she only asks to show him how the real world works in which chase ya shes terrible  edit i misread it as 250 a month 250 a week is dispicable	pos
she takes 80 of the income for a room and some basic housing based on apparently nothing  this is terrible either way	pos
i read that as 250 a month the first time  250 a week is terrible in every sense and ya no mother should be that greedyespecially when it comes to there child	neg
no yea 250 a month would be perfectly acceptable  you make your own money you can help the household a bit  absolutely fine  that is preparing for the real world in a sensible reasonable way while also saying look youre 22 you can help out a bit  im good with that  but 1000 a month when making 1300 thats disgusting as a parent	pos
yep  most of us understand it to some capacity and i hope we can create a culture of community and collective responsibility to help  but theres only so much i can do outside of my circles	pos
in an urgent world it is radical to move at your own pace	pos
try and join a club at your college  if there isnt already start a commuter club  get a space to call the commuter lounge  you can also get a job at your school	pos
its tough out there maybe try moving closer to college if you can afford it or try join a sport	pos
an easy alternative when travel and location becomes an issue is online friends  plenty of people out there who would be more than happy to make a new friend	pos
not sure how your college work but you could always talk to whoever you sit next to  as long as youre a good listener people will appreciate you	pos
i second joining a club  or join a study group  theres also probably groups or events specifically for making friends as many colleges do things like that	pos
bumble bff is decent  you could also join a gym and slowly make friends with the people your age there	pos
unfortunately i live at home and i am probably among the least athletic people but thank you so much for your ideas   3	pos
my school is small and really doesnt have many clubs unfortunately  thank you for your ideas though	pos
oh dont worry you dont have to be athletic to still play sports  i get winded after running a 100m last in every race and still played a sport that involved a lot of running  i never won any trophies for it and was probably among the worst in my team but i still had fun  just pick something regardless of if your any good at it	pos
1826 is a young adult range that could only be conceived by someone under like 22 or 23  lol if you think young adulthood ends at 26 you have to be waaaaay younger than 27	pos
for now finding a job  ive changed up my resume so many times that i lost count  been ghosted too after an interview	neg
besides dicktatorship of a uni filled to the brim with sadists uncertanity of my career not having fucked someone despite being almost 22 and a fit athletic lad  boi i need to lower my standards this year ig  oh and not knowing whenz again am i gonna be sitting at picadily with cupid	pos
rn  chores	neg
at this moment im stressed on if i should buy this house now or wait till the crash  i am pulling the trigger now because i can afford it now  the best time to buy is when you can afford it  but i still questioning even tho i am doing it	neg
right now my girlfriend but thats because we just went long distance as my job for the coming at least 3 months is a 4 hour drive away from her  this is my first relationship and shes spending more time with her friends now that im away  i dont know most of these friends and its stressing me out	pos
lack of money	neg
finances	neg
i have to withdrawal from college because i cant afford it  i hav3 a job but idk if i can find a place to rent with the prices in this town  i could move home but its so crowded and i would make a 3rd what i do now and it would be hell trying to get back out  i love my mother and family but i could not do that god awful town it has less than 1000 people living in it and theres no opportunity	neg
work  bad managers micromanagement everything was a life or death stright up telling you youll be fired for this or i will let you guys sink before i do	neg
people	neg
fucking up and knowing theres nothing i can do to fix the mistake except move on and try again	neg
feel you went through that recently as well  everything has a solution except the loss of health  im really sorry	pos
besides that im pretty stress free tbh	pos
yes thats the sad truth of growing up  your responsibilities add up and youre expected to fulfill them with the same or less time as before  the challenge is taking care of all our adult necessities in an established routinely manner as well as keep yourself happy and satisfied	pos
nah but i swear its better than school cuz at least you get after work and weekends off  with school im tied to assignments and studying after classes are over	pos
yes  unless you have money	pos
you have to utilize time outside of work or else youll be miserable  i know it seems easier to lay in bed but time blocking really helped me see how much time i had left  also a semblance of a life plan bc if you absolutely hate your job youll never be happy	neg
probably thats why its important to find work that you love because you will spend most of your time doing it  life isnt about earning money its about spending your time on things you like money just buys you more time	pos
ngl  it been hard because of my mental health lately i been snapping at people like my friends and family maybe because all the stress which i didnt mean to cause im working part time job doing 3 classes and i am noticing that im not taking care of myself at all	neg
agreed  once im debt free ill feel more comfortable changing jobs to lower paying and lower stress  for now i guess ill be living for the weekends	neg
that sounds rough  its a constant cycle of suck  you dont feel well and it sucks  you have to continue allocating time to doing things you dont want to and it sucks  you want to have fun but sometimes doing things you lovelike just end up sucking  but the worst is if you neglect or push these things aside for a later time everything is going to get worse and that frecken sucks  ive found that what helps me is 1  acknowledge that it sucks  it all sucks and i know i dont want it to keep sucking  2  manage your time  do something to chip away not push away  2a  got tons of chores to do in so little time dont do everything  clean some dishes spot clean the home set your laundry aside ready to be loaded into the wash  or do laundry and while thats being ran cook some food and do some dishes inbetween  3  realize you will need to give something up in order to catch up or get ahead  4  realize each day wont be the same as the last  sometimes its better to break off tasks for certain days  i grocery shop and fill up gas on saturdays i meal prep on sundays i play games during weekdays just before bed and if i cant game that day then its because i used that time for other things	neg
no hoodie  get a few pairs of nice clean simple slacks in varied and muted colors  then get a ton of fitted button ups  some with plaid  some a single color  boom  classy  dont forget a nice belt  roll up sleeves to bend in your arm  ladies love forearms	pos
first off good job  it looks really cute and pretty  the inly issue i have is that everything moves around so much that the eye cannot really focus on what is important  i would suggest that the text stops moving once it appeared or soon after that  i like the white spots moving around like jelly but maybe not the elements inside  like the caty   and maybe the other elements that move could do so one at a time instead of all at once  thinkng about the arrows and the lines  but again really well done	pos
ever realised how as time passes less and less channels have introsoutros that being said it looks nice but for an intro too long   oh you showed both  then theyre fine lengthwise  these are the only ideas that come to mind  make the title of the video the main text in the intro  else its going to be repetitive for the viewers and theyll end up skipping it   add a place in the outro for recommended videos and your channels icon	pos
its you that im concerned about not the product  im concerned about your attachment to your product and then placing yourself at the mercy of other peoples opinions  acceptance or rejection	pos
okay	pos
honestly that looks good for a starter channel  as long as the content is good id be okay with this type of intro and outro	pos
thank you for constructive criticism  i will change the cat and the text on the outro to not move  and ill remove the lines above the girl  find lines that arent animated  in your opinion on the outro should i have like comment subscribe still move or should i have jeniluvya move  or none thanks again	pos
most of the channels i watch do have intros a short introduction in the middle of the video so honestly havent noticed  but after looking on reddit i notice most say exactly what you said  i suppose with the niche im going for im unsure how to begin my videos without an intro	neg
i think like comment subscribe should not move that much  i dont know what is possible but i would either make it move way more slowly  and maybe not all on the same beat  or make it just freeze   i like the way jeniluvya appears in an animated way and then stops it makes my eye focus on the name at first then it allows it to go around the rest of the sreen and i can see all the details i dont know if im super clear because english isnt my forst language but i hope it helps	pos
your english is great  thank you so much for the advice	pos
this tendency always happens  when groups large and small have no positive productive and cohesive direction they tend to use their efforts to first attack others and then attack people within their own group  these individuals havent yet developed personal discipline  while a disciplined group will however use their energies to come up with constructive ways of dealing with difficulties	neg
a  tell your mom hes a friend of a friend and you met him while you were out with your friends  he was with your group and you got chatting  this is a pretty normal way for people to meet and it means you dont have to know anything about the guy  b  relax enjoy yourself  you are not your sister and you are not your mom  c  youll need to become more independent from your mom at some point in your life and you cant live your life just making her happy forever  she will have to let go of her control over you too and learn to trust you to look after yourself at some point  23 is a good enough time to start this journey  d  have a great date	pos
can you tell your parents you met him through different means like through a friend or something	pos
go on the date but do your best to not to try to appease him  dont worry about your mom youre a whole ass adult and its time for her to let you live your life  just try your best to not let the rose colored glasses hide the flaws  the imperfections make them human and if you able to see them as just a regular person it makes it easier to not try to appease them  i know its corny advice but be yourself faults and all its a good way to see if theyre a good fit  if you scare them off by being yourself its for the best then  not saying you gotta show them all the skeletons in your closet but dont try to be someone you think they want	pos
i second this  i would skip the 1st part but i agree with you  if their mother is not emotionally manipulating i think they can sit down and talk about the fact that they should be more independent from each other	pos
im sure youll be able to learn it just fine  its coming up with enough bs to fill a word limit that is the hard part	pos
i feel the same way    im also 21	neg
i think mental health is always weird and forever will be  what i do hope is that we as a society handle it better for future generations	pos
true  lately i have been feeling guilty for how i turned out to be because i want to be able to have the life i can live but i remember that my well being is important if i want to have the life i can have	pos
its very hard to navigate though this world and personal life  i wish the best for you  we are here for you	pos
if you have a particular hobby maybe you could try to a store that sells products for your particular hobby to meet like minded people  going out to bars can be a good way of meeting new people too  you could also do some research to see if there any local clubs for something you enjoy or have always wanted to try  the other alternative is online friends theres absolutely nothing wrong with that	pos
welcome back to ny you can make friends through your job or school  the other way is through online games if you have any hobbies you can also go to places in the city that have those	pos
so i kinda had the same thing going on  i moved back home to wisconsin and all my friends had moved on with their live  so i just started regularly going to a bar  its a bit rough at first but eventually the bartender recognized me and boom im a trusted regular who doesnt cause problems  the point is once i started regularly going i met a few new friends and now when i pop in i can at least count on a decent chat with the bar tenders or my friends  weve been making plans for the summer so im looking forward to that  hope this help and dont be afraid to approach someone and just start a conversation  you can always dip if its no good	pos
theres nothing wrong with you  i did the same thing at least three times  i did well in high school but i was burnt out after  im hoping to try again this year or the next  college isnt for everyone and you dont have to rush things  take some time and figure out what you want to do  maybe get a job or find some skills you would like to learn  you dont have to immediately go to college or go to college at all	pos
man let me tell you its so normal to be lost  im in almost exactly your shoes  just turned 20 and dont really know where im going  its hard to enter your 20s  i think a lot of it is normal  what helped me is try to just define some things you value  it could be anything  your health money family some hobby a particular activity or interest  shape your life around just doing things you value  set a few simple goals every weekmonth  reflect on where youd like to see yourself in 10 years  try new things expose yourself to new ideas  reading books is working very good for that for me  i think close to nobody got everything completely figured out  just try your best to stay true to yourself and along the way meaning will find you  with more life experience it will come eventually	pos
first only like 1 in 3 people in the us  assuming thats where you are  are college grads so its not this horrible thing if its just not for you  idk what your year was or how many credits you have but if an associates or trade school would make better sense those are really good options that would set you up for life  this post tho sounds a lot like me when my depression was spiraling so if you have access to a therapist or counselor id honestly start there  in the meantime jobwise you could get something parttime either retailsales or manufacturingwarehouse and just stay and gain experience from those for a future resume while youre figuring stuff out	pos
im 22 and just dropped out of college for the second time because i really dont love what im doing  for the last few years it feels like i have to be on 247  either im in class or im at home with a ton of assignments to do and if i choose to do something in an attempt to relax its impossible because all i can honk about is the assignments i should be doing  ive found it impossible to make it through without being stressed 247 and i just cant do it anymore  i would say if youre going to drop out you need to have some sort of plan even if its just to work a job to make by until you figure out what you want to do with your life  wishing you luck	pos
i was off and on again with college for 2 years before fully dropping out  theres others avenues in life if youre will to take a leap of faith	pos
honestly i just think some people arent ambitious and thats okay  you might become a manager at subway and stay there your whole life  and thats okay    if youre happy and making enough money to live then dont stress  everyone is different and you dont need college	pos
honestly the fact she doesnt have those same cookie cutter veneers we see way too much of is another major bonus  i love how natural she is	pos
is it just me or does the bathroom behind her look ridiculously normal like i wouldnt expect her shower to look like that edit this is not a criticism of her by any means  im just intrigued	pos
how can she look so fresh at 49 after all that she went through at such a young age she looks amazing  ive only smoked cigarettes  no drugs  and look like her in my 30s	pos
of course that is one of her bathrooms shes posted from it numerous times and has even addressed people asking  ive always wished the best for her she really had a rough start and seems really happy now	pos
she is so real  and her house looks super normal like when she was watching tv in that ridiculously small tv not that long ago	pos
shes so real  all the time  love her	pos
shes made some major missteps but i have to hand it to her that she really does try to be authentic flaws and all  i find her really endearing	pos
ive always loved her shes always been so beautiful in her own unique way  i could actually see myself in her   her face isnt symmetrical  like mine  and she embraces it and makes me remember that you can be gorgeous even if you dont fit the standard	pos
as far as celebrities go i cant think of many more authentic ones out there than her  for those that only know her from the last 5 years image search her or check out youtube  shes had a crazy hollywood ride  you wouldnt guess what you see today is the same person who made a million crotchety people freak out on letterman	neg
awesome	pos
im still looking for her shade from that commercial she models of garnier nutrisse hair color  it would look nice on a lot of people maybe me too	pos
shes so beautiful  i love her	pos
shes one of my favorite celebrities   she has always seemed so chill and thoughtful	pos
i thought for a moment you were suggesting she was shopping and i was about to unleash my full stan powers no matter how glaring the evidence was  not my 90s flower child	neg
my childhood crush is now 49 yeesh im gettin old	neg
okay but the washroom has to be fake   i refuse to believe someone who makes as much money as her would accept that showerhead	neg
because of this actual reel i went out and bought that highlighter concealer thing and the blush a few weeks back  i love them  highly recommend	pos
for those commenting on the bathroom i think its her master bath  watch this video until the end	neg
she is iconic and i never use that word  she has literally been one of the only consistent things in my life since i was in eighth grade and im almost 38  life evolves everything changes people die chapters close and time marches on but her show is still on tv   i work in lower manhattan and i often wonder how id react if i saw her somewhere lol  my therapist used to do a lot of outreach work for dvsa victims and shes collaborated with her charity several times and she only has lovely things to say about her	pos
i would have guessed shes a well preserved 52 years old  but in her 60s wow  shes a great person beautiful inside and out	pos
she is so beautiful tbh  20 years ago and now too	pos
i love her and her hubby so much  absolutely top people	pos
so beautiful  lovee her	pos
in her famous show thats been running for over two decades she has aged so gracefully and never used any filters that make her skin texture disappear like other characters  beautiful and inspiring	pos
uh    can someone tell me who she is	neg
she looks fabulous  absolute stunner at any age	pos
she gets botox in her forehead but largely leaves the rest of her face alone  its a pretty good compromise in the harsh to women world of tv and movies imo	pos
so beautiful  i love the second pic in particular	pos
love this   im just starting with fine lines at 30 and im struggling with it more than i expected im loving seeing these photos	pos
gosh she is a sight to behold  absolutely stunning	pos
thats what bothers me about famous women even those who you would think have a message of body acceptance retouch their photos	pos
her sister and her both be killing me with their photoshopping  they both have lovely shapes but the pressure to standoutbe perfect gets to everybody eventually	pos
this is why nobody bought that she wasnt pregnant  her body is amazing and i wish she didnt feel the need for this	pos
aint just the waist  shes enhanced her chest area too	neg
seeing this makes me genuinely sad already has such a great shape and yet its not enough when will we ever be enough	pos
nothing is real on ig	neg
i started taking acting classes recently  we have to watch all of our scenes  ive noticed that ive gotten really obsessive about the way i look  which isnt terrible  ive started really watching what i eat and i have an entire skincare routine and i pay a lot more attention to my hair  everytime i see myself i find a new thing to hate  im starting to get why these celebrities do this stuff	neg
her body looks amazing in the before  social media is awful	pos
side note her arms are very short	neg
omg she is the last person who needs to do this  she has a very delicate beauty to her she reminds me of a little fairy  i guess no matter how gorgeous you are you are not immune to bad self esteem	pos
she literally just had a baby she looks fantastic she doesnt need to do this	pos
the wild thing is that 90 of the edited images on this sub are of women who are objectively thin  fit and dont need it whatsoever  sad  edit obviously no one needs to edit themselves  you know what i mean	neg
girl please  stop it  you are already so beautiful that its unnecessary and you are setting an impossible bar for the little girls coming up that are watching the filtered photos and thinking thats what they need to emulate  its actually quite cruel	pos
it breaks my heart to see her edited down into nothingness  girl is soooo pretty this is abusive and i wonder if she even knows its happening  like does she really manager her social media   imagine she didnt and the damage it will cause when she sees it edited ugh	pos
her real body is very beautiful and proportionate  the picture on the right is something that doesnt look good in reality  it only sounds good as a concept but when i see these edited proportions they look off and so not natural and normal  i prefer the picture on the left over the one on the right any day	neg
i think she just had a baby might be contributing to the perceived need to photoshop a more defined waist  women in hollywood are put under a large and unfair amount of pressure to get back to their prebaby body right away	neg
shes already beautiful why	pos
how does a 47 year old look older than a 65 year old oh yeah filters  though what i know of him he probably appreciates not being filtered to fuck	pos
i keep reading it as im fixed	neg
at first i thought that said leave me alone im fixed	neg
why is she dressed like marie antoinette on a 3day bender	pos
i love how she always wears gloves because you can see how old she is from her hands  cant filter her hands are arms	pos
ive had a crush on him since 2007  still just as gorgeous too  no filters needed for that irish king  prob wouldnt know how to use a filter anyway	pos
thought that was one of the silva twins	neg
she didnt even look like that when she was 20  this is so cringey	neg
ursula stop	neg
i adore him already but the fact that he lets his irish skin be what it is as he nears 50    makes me love him more  im sure hes gottengetting fillers or whatever but he regularly appears with normal wrinkles and texture issues and im fucking here for it  my irishdescended recognizes  eta he has the most beautiful face ive ever seen	pos
shes trying really hard nowadays with her social media presence and it sucks for her that at this point in her life and career every imperfection and every bad angle gets shown through mass media  that all being said it doesnt give her free pass when it comes to shopping yourself to shit everywhere your face is  shes hiding and everytime shes shown with anything exposing skin from the chin down its a horror show  she cant escape the reality of things forever at some point its gonna punch her back to reality and hard	neg
shes just embarrassing herself at this point  her head looks pasted onto her body	neg
the sad part is a good 30 of women have all lost their skin texture thanks to these damn beautification filters  its become normalized  i hate it here	neg
ok but his eyes though  stunning	pos
oh brother  shes old enough to be his mom  stop	neg
whats funny about these pictures is that no matter what we do know what she really looks like  so this is an obvious vanity post versus a fun post	pos
well i mean she needs the sign because her face doesnt move anymore youd never know she was tired or sad or happy or anything but ready for a photo  because her face is more plastic than flesh at this point	pos
i love this man  so talented and down to earth  she looks    oof  material indeed	pos
she really is with all shes been through health wise	pos
i am forever inlove with her eyebrows  they have a life of their own	neg
apparently this was flooded with guys saying shit like wow she really hit the wall bc a 37 yr old has wrinkles when she smiles    anyways if any of those guys saw her in person theyd probably be stunned by her beauty  but people see someone on their screen and its just an excuse for them to unleash their hate for women without any repercussions  easier to objectify through a screen	neg
shes got a beautiful smile   this is just such a casual photo like something id snap in a second and send to a mate	pos
i will love her forever  she holds such a special place in my heart  muh queen	pos
i love watching older movies where people have lines and have imperfect teeth  actors just look average and relatable	pos
what a gorgeous woman  she seems as pretty inside as outside	pos
thats how eyes should look when a person smiles  gotta love it	pos
its nice to see someone my age who actually lets themself age  even girls i went to school with are going heavy on the botox which makes them look worse than just letting it happen	neg
i love this so much  shes bloody gorgeous and amazing	pos
i find emilia charismatic and charming  with what shes endured medically  two brain aneurysms     she deserves a peaceful life  she seems so sincerely down to earth that its refreshing	pos
i am 32 and have the most prominent crows eyes  it has been an insecurity of mine but when my fiance told me it attracted him because it meant i smiled a lot  seeing it in that perspective made me love them	pos
such a natural beauty  always loved her	pos
is this the person who said she was too muscular for her obgyn	neg
i believe her when she says she doesnt edit her pictures  its obvious someone did the editing for her	neg
omg i thought the bottom two were our special canadian gorl	pos
how could the real life husband still want to be with someone that blatantly lied and misrepresented and obviously looks completely different from her pictures	neg
i see the 2 weight loss surgeries and chin lipo are still holding strong	pos
didnt she have wls within the past year or two is the bottom right photo recent	neg
didnt she get weight loss surgery	neg
oh shes definitely a contender in top 10 worst edit vs real life	neg
honestly those actually dont look edited i see real skin texture and proportions  they could just be the work of better angles or maybe when she weighed less	pos
i mean it just looks like very good angles vs very not good angles	pos
i can easily make myself look like all these pictures  i think this is more of an example of how angles  and makeup  work than proof that she photoshops her pictures	pos
the examples youve included dont really seem edited just good angles and makeup why would anyone post a photo at a bad angle like that	pos
to be fair as a fat woman i can look similar to any of the above without editing depending on angles lighting lens etc	pos
lol this is the same woman who was over 400 pounds claiming to be a classic size 18 and now has lost over 100 pounds through gastric bypass surgery and is still claiming that shes a size 18  how does that work exactly maam we have eyes	pos
i quit watching her once i saw she was sabotaging herself over and over	neg
doesnt look like photo editing  just a ton of makeup and angles	neg
wasnt she the one who had her stomach fat apron removed and lied about that to her followers	neg
i feel like a lot of this could be just makeup and good lighting  my skin looks different when i dont have makeup on and under direct vs indirect light	pos
isnt that just posing and forcing good angles	pos
ah i forgot her name    i remember her from youtube  wasnt she married or about to marry and then left the guy	neg
the surgeries she got lend themselves really well to pictures on social media  in real life though she looks so strange and uncanny  its sad because when she just had her lips done and thats it she was so beautiful  she looked cute without the lips too but this is just   im 34 and my skin looks about like hers  thats not good   shes like 23	pos
theres something about her that i cant quite ever place  a familiarity to someone or something else  drives me nuts  i mean her real face not the tuned version	neg
the cheek fillers or implants or whatever definitely give her stink face  it looks like shes constantly judging you for farting in an elevator	pos
i think she would seem less startlingly odd looking if she just embraced the wonky eye levels and posted natural pics instead of the equivalent of instagram fan fiction	pos
i feel like her original face almost looks closer to what shes editing herself into than her current face	pos
imagine spending so much money on your face and still being so unhappy with it  i know that shes rich but it is terryfing to think what life like that costs mentally	pos
she looked her best and happiest during her kingk era  i miss that style of hers  she looks so much older than her age now  there seriously needs to be a case study into this	pos
those girls never stood a chance with the kind of sisters and family they had	neg
the art she and her team create is hot af but she always looks puffy wonky eyed and awkward af when shes captured out in the wild	neg
i honestly cant tell thats the same person	pos
she definitely pairs better with heavier makeup	pos
she looks like she smelled a fart but doesnt know who dealt it	pos
i saw a reel about how these faces all looked like they are smelling something bad and i cant unsee it	neg
i used this side by side example to explain to my 8 year old daughter why social media is so bad for the female selfimage  thanks	neg
why the filling of her cupids bow with lipstick anyone know it looks weird  like she didnt use a mirror to put it on	pos
reality is so beautiful  why filter	pos
ive never noticed before that she draws over her cupids bow  whyyy	neg
even their filters have filters	neg
the right looks like like a madame tussaud wax sculpture of the left	pos
right looks like shes heading towards the bat eating head musician dudes wife	pos
i saw her giving commentary on a show about 90s trends  i was so impressed that she has aged naturally and still looks like herself  love love love her	pos
yay  a middleaged woman not soft filtering their skin into ridiculous perfection   edit im a middle aged woman	pos
this image was taken on set and she was dressed up as her character in a true crime film  the undereye smudge and crazy hair are part of the look	neg
i was on a southwest flight with her 10 years ago and she was so normal and down to earth  she was traveling with her husband and kids and she looked like a normal mom	pos
i met her in tahoe once and she was lovely	pos
her book is really good  she had an amazing upbringing and her parents did great with her	pos
she still looks so pretty i knew who she was instantly	pos
this is beauty without bullshit  everyones got it	pos
its an honor to age really    i cant wait to see what i look like when im old  shes really pretty	pos
she actually looks really good  smooth skin good brows and most importantly she still looks like herself	pos
she looks pretty as always	pos
still beautiful	pos
i love her so much shes a great role model	pos
lovely	pos
gorgeous and lovely to see	pos
ive had a crush on her for years now  shes still incredibly gorgeous	pos
still cute  should save for later to remind yourself	pos
shes in makeup and costume shooting a true crime film so she normally looks much better than this	pos
using real people  albeit unbelievably gorgeous ones  with real unedited skin actually sells the product so much better because we can actually see what it does   i want this tint so bad lol	pos
god dammit i have no idea who it is but i really want the product  curse you rule one	neg
she looks amazing  wish the product wasnt 50 this ad definitely sold me	pos
my god that woman is fucking gorgeous	pos
i would love to buy this product  i wish we could at least know the name of the makeup line	pos
see that dark area on her right cheek at the top i have the same thing and it is hard to cover up  i need to check this makeup out because it made it disappear	neg
what the hell    im sold influenced and my card is ready	neg
unfortunately theres definitely some editing going on here  i cant say exactly how much but theres definitely some color correction and probably some smoothing  especially eyelids smile lines and other wrinkles   a dead giveaway is that they accidentally made part of the tear ductinner corner of white when they were whitening the eyes in the after picture  and that is definitely not part of the makeup  still a big step in the right direction tho  totally more realistic than usual ads and its great to see more mature skin	pos
ive no idea what brand this is  are we allowed to post clues and hints help	pos
wow  i need this tint	pos
oh my gosh this makes me want to buy it for my mum  what a gorgeous result	pos
that model is gorgeous  and if that skin tint performs as well as these photos make it look then im sold  will get one for my mom too  brilliant marketing	pos
wow literally stunning	pos
she looks fabulous  i literally have no idea how old she is but i only hope i age this well	pos
this lady is stunning  nothing influences me more than people with textured or matured unfiltered skin modeling a good product	pos
were seeing what the product actually does to her face  absolutely gorgeous	pos
wow what an amazing result	pos
beautiful woman	pos
having some integrity and authenticity goes a long way when it comes to promotion of beauty products  these pictures have me wanting to try it and im in my early 20s lol	pos
unrelated but im obsessed with her nose   so unique	neg
professor quirrell needs to fix his turban  his voldemort is showing	neg
shes a picasso	neg
looks like her soul is leaving her body	pos
i dont always use an ai generated face but when i do i like to wear it on the left	pos
you sure are dedicated	pos
maybe she watched the tape from the ring  that distorts the face in photos	neg
has anyone started a filter fail sub if not i nominate this for the first pic	neg
i think its great that people with disabilities are living their best life	pos
pro tip screen record then go back and slide to the frame  i do that when it becomes too difficult to screenshot the perfect part lol	pos
does she like    faceswap a good pic of herself on her face im so confused lmfao	pos
you deserve an award for this  thank you	pos
oh lort  the neighbors probably heard the laugh i let out when i saw this  this is perfect	pos
theyre making a live action adaptation of junji itos tomie	neg
wow what app can make such a horror movie like this	pos
doing the lords work while simultaneously unlocking new sleep paralysis demons	neg
narrator the best was in fact not yet to come	pos
i used to think everyone was looking the same from all the plastic surgery but now i realize they are just all using the same filters	neg
she used to remind me of idina menzel  not any longer	neg
waiting for the ocean to do what it does best	pos
this looks like one of those apps where you upload your picture and it puts you in different backgrounds  they can never get nailtoe polish right	pos
okay in this case not to defend her just a photo editor myself look at the surfboard strap on her ankle  its also a saturated green and the yellow paint has a green tint  this means she likely didnt photoshop or add the green nail polish she just turned up the green saturation on her photo editor to probably make the ocean a prettier blue  green and it resulted in making actual green pop even more	pos
when i was a teenager there was a period of time when i wanted dreadlocks  i am so effing glad my mom shammed me out of it	pos
i have followed this chick for years  since before her current persona  she was cute as a button with the sweetest voice  when i rediscovered her i was literally shocked  she looks soo different  i think she could have had more mainstream success but she is pigeonholed now	pos
why didnt she edit that giant woodtick off the middle of her forehead	neg
this is soooo weird maybe she had a partnershipsponsorship with some salon and has to show nails done all the time	neg
the painted nails completely off the foot	neg
imagine doing something as fun and cool as surfing and youre worried about what your nails look like    let it go girl	pos
for all her spirituality blathers shes just as shallow as the next guy	neg
she has a tattoo on her arm that says dont forget to love yourself	neg
i do not understand why people post such edited pictures that it looks nothing like them  do they not have friends to tell them its over the top	neg
i like her natural face in pic 2  she has kind eyes	pos
bless her heart  anyone know what the graffiti font says on her chest	pos
slightly off topic can anyone figure out what her above eyebrow tattoo says i feel like letters i think i recognise dont form a word so im thinking its not english	pos
she looks happy  im just going to wish her the best and stay out of her way	pos
i think she forgot to love herself  weird because she wrote a note	pos
her face  mouth  tattoo has so many teeth	neg
i think i have seen her in german tv before but i dont remember where	neg
i thought this was a youtuber that is controversial and now has a baby and a second one on the way  known for getting a lot of fillers botox etc  anyone else see the resemblance	neg
i would be ashamed in front of people who know me and know how i look in reality   i always think about this when i see posts like this one	neg
the bait and switch reality is why i refuse to get on dating apps again  its partially why i got off them back in 2016 and havent been back since  stuff like this is what i was running into  if you gotta edit your self to be thinner thats a confidence issue and youre lying  two things i dont admire  show your actual self first off and tell the truth  i was seeing it all  from photos like this to lying about age  im looking for somebody my age not jailbait or 10 years older	neg
i guess this look has gone international if most of her tattoos are in german  fascinating	pos
the gasp i gusped	neg
sacred heart  do all these ludicrously filtered people imagine that nobody they know ever sees all this nonsense and if so whom are they trying to deceiveimpress anyway strangers on ig  ok but to what end	neg
i see beautiful glowing expensivelymaintained skin  and you know what i also see pores and texture  gorgeous	pos
what id do to have skin like that     monthly breakouts will be my undoing	pos
he looks fabulous	pos
this is what theyre trying to cover up	neg
ugh my bias  he has always been adorable but in last 2 years hes really hit his stride	neg
i think i could get into kpop if they let the idols stay unfiltered this man is gorgeous	pos
never thought id see a picture of him on this sub  his skin is fantastic i wish mine looked half as good  hes so handsome	pos
so handsome  im always a little unnerved when publicity photos of kpop idols sometimes crop up on my feed because they often filter them all to have the same bleachwhite flawless skin to the point where they dont even seem to have dimension to their faces  it happens in the west too of course but it seems especially prevalent in kpop  this man is exceedingly goodlooking with gorgeous skin and yet im sure he probably gets dealt the same treatment  so bizarre to me	pos
not being familiar with kpop idols i thought this was the filtered photo and tried to swipe to see an unfiltered photo  yeah he doesnt need a filter	pos
goddam	neg
he probably had one of the best skins even by korean standards	pos
idk why youd photoshop someone already so hot  strange times were living in	neg
hes absolute perfection  he doesnt need any filters	pos
so   a really attractive adult man this is the bizarre part of all the alteration  in reality hes gorgeous  as a plastic skinned doll he is weirdly inhuman	pos
was it posted by his social media team or someone else	neg
he looks so much better this way	pos
i absolutely hate the heavy whitewashing and filtering they do on kpop idols across the board  its ridiculous but i guess it goes hand in hand with the ridiculous beauty standards that sk holds  he looks sooooo damn handsome here  normalize reality damn it	pos
texture on faces is real	neg
thats the korean glass skin regimen for you  he looks damn good and doesnt need filters	pos
they always look better in person  hes amazing	pos
this is the first post ive seen on here that legit scares me  we are entering child pornographyfetish sht here  i wonder if you can report it on ig	neg
these girls are profiting from pedophiles on of they edit their faces to look underage and make mad money doing it  im surprised its legal	pos
porn culture or whatever you want to call it is repulsive with its obsession with jailbait or barely legal categories  there should not be a market for it and i guarantee its not teen boys looking at this shit  its grown ass men  many of which are fathers  thats terrifying to me	neg
oh god  this makes me feel sick	neg
re photo number 4 this is not the first time where ive seen a womangirl do this pose against the wall outside of a strip mall or something  can you imagine youre a normal person on your lunch break heading to the chipotle in the strip mall off broadway ave  to grab a burrito bowl  you get to the strip mall find a parking spot and head for the door  youre one in a long line shuffling into this chipotle  just as you reach the door the girl in tightfitting clothes directly in front stops throws her nasty carpet grippers up on the wall to the right arches her back pushes her butt out while holding the door handle and starts looking over her shoulder  shes mugging for the guy you had previously assumed is her boyfriend as he furiously snaps photos on his camera phone changing angles occasionally   who knows maybe he is her boyfriend who cares  what  do  you  do what do you do if you witness this shit irl	neg
gross	neg
i genuinely thought these were young teenage kids until i read about of in the caption  this is disgusting what a great way to encourage paedophilia	pos
third is without filters    no     no it isnt	pos
when we visited tokyo we tried out one of those fun photobooth things we kept looking for a normal one that maybe just added some cool effects but a lot of them created this weird filter  my husband and i had a laugh but we also thought it was weird that anyone would want to intentionally look like that in their pics  the intentionally photoshopped look is apparently kind of a trend in some places  last picture is super creepy tho	pos
third picture is her wearing korean circle lenses that are a diameter too big for the doll eye effect with strategic use of eye tape and make up  circa 2013ish her look is very dated  i have similar lenses thatll give me a very similar bug eyed stare   i dress in elegant gothic lolita style and i like channeling an antique doll look   also her eye shape is definitely further surgically altered to be bigger  yes  probably exactly what youre thinking  as in she was rumored to slit the outer edges of her eyes so she could widen them more  its a common surgery done in south korea  women from all over asia go there to do it to even out eye shape or just alter the eyes  my cousin had it done for personal reasons as well  theres a documentary on youtube about it too	pos
wow	pos
i hope to god the third one is filtered  or she spent a lot of money trying to look just like momo	pos
i guess at least with these extreme edits theyre not trying to pretend its natural	pos
yeesh  that sure is a look	pos
is this the real momo shes terrifying both ways	neg
girl be ffr right now  the edited pictures look uncanny already but even the less edited one is kinda creepy	neg
im so confused on why anyone would do this to their own pictures  it doesnt even look good it looks creepy	neg
in what world or culture can this ever be considered attractive i know beauty standards worldwide are different but this is giving me major uncanny valley vibes  she doesnt look human and its really off putting to look at	pos
the first two pictures did not prepare me for the third  the first two i was like yet another chick pretending to be an irl waifu nbd  zero threats detected  seeing the third gave me such a visceral primal uncanny valley response that i actually gagged  i was fully expecting to see just a normal human being but got surprised by person with momo face idk thats probably dramatic but i did not like that surprise at all lol	pos
what in the dollar tree remake of the ring is this	neg
oh god scary	neg
interesting  the edited version totally changes how the dress lays on the model  i appreciate seeing it unedited but why edit it so much just to show the before this is what it looks like in fantasy land ok	pos
photo editing that changes the way the clothing looks is the worst  this is why i rely on reviews with photos to see what something looks like before i buy it online	neg
thats crazy  editing clothing garments should be illegal  im sure with this level of editing they get a ton of returns  its a totally different dress in real life  they have edited it to be longer and more waist definition  why not just construct the dress that way to begin with	neg
whats even the point of posting the edited one it will never look like that in real life on a real human  wtf	neg
they changed the colour too  how do people know what shade to trust	pos
as someone who has worked in clothing design this pisses me right the fuck off  they didnt just shop her waist they altered the color of the dress and the way the fabric behaves  the real dress looks like its made of a cotton or linen based woven fabric with a fair amount of ease built in  the imaginary dress looks like its made out of a synthetic based jersey fabric with negative ease  its an entirely different garment	pos
i genuinely prefer the non edited one  her body is perfect  im so sick of exaggerated hour glass figures  bleah	neg
they got her face her waist her legs her arms  they changed the dress color shape drape  im glad they do this but damn	neg
even the color of the dress looks different  almost more shiny  youd never be able to tell the true color of the dress until you got it	pos
false advertisement is literally illegal in the uk btw but literally nothing ever happens to these shitty companies when they falsely advertise  according to the business protection from misleading marketing regulations 2008 prohibition of advertising which misleads traders 3   1  advertising which is misleading is prohibited   2  advertising is misleading which  a  in any way including its presentation deceives or is likely to deceive the traders to whom it is addressed or whom it reaches and by reason of its deceptive nature is likely to affect their economic behaviour remember the whole mikayla controversy where she added false lashes to a mascara ad     yeah that is illegal too  but nothing will happen to loreal or any of the huge companies that do this  it actually enfuriates me	neg
she looks wayyyyy sexier in the real version  but maybe thats just me    things are so warped that people can no longer look at a real body and find it attractive	pos
they couldnt just either find a model that fit the clothes or design better fitting clothes they edited her legs too	pos
how is this not false advertising can they be possibly sued for this the editing distorts how the dress lays on her body the texture of the fabric etc	neg
how we wish our clothes look vs  the reality of how our clothes look	pos
i would actually love if online fashion did this always  they can keep their photoshopped thumbnail if they show me what it really looks like in the next photo  way easier to decide whether ill like it on me when i see it on a variety of body types even if one of those is photoshopped lol	pos
like why i hate this stuff so much  she looks so beautiful as she is normally like please stop selling these unrealistic standards that even models cannot attain	pos
the color is completely fucking different the drape of the dress is different the fit is different  annoying	neg
i feel like the waist editing has also contributed to the appearance of negative stomach  in the edited image her whole tummy area looks totally flat  they photoshopped her internal organs away	neg
so the dress is darker longer tighter at the waist and appears to have a totally different back with more fabric    their return rate is probably high	neg
not only is her figure exaggerated but they edited out one of her knees  like how does her knee thigh and calf all fit behind the other calf and that unnecessary gap between the ankles  ridiculous	pos
yeah    shes also posted deepfake nudes of her ex bf so yeah shes not right in the head	pos
i understand body dysmorphia is a thing  but i cannot understand how you can edit your waist to be the same size as your head or sometimes neck and not see how blatantly obvious that editing it	neg
no  7 is hilarious  wtaf	pos
i wish these fckin filters would get banned  theyve destroyed any sense of normalcy  i hate them	neg
how does anybody truly believe this is real like im more concerned for the people who are idolizing her body then i am her	pos
she looks good without it  its sad to be this insecure	pos
edtwt is a fucking hellhole	neg
this is really sad dude  imagine being so conventionally good looking and still not being happy with your looks so you morph yourself into something that doesnt look human	neg
like why even youre already skinny enough my gosh	pos
happy csection anniversary wtf	neg
what is it with these outrageous duck butts	neg
sorry too busy vomitting at how disgusting that looks to say anything of value  ive been a gym rat for 22 years since i was 16 and i have never and will never see anyone who actually looks like that anywhere in the world  mental illness needs to stop being cheered on	neg
imagine if wed had photoshop and social media back in the heroin chic days	neg
ummm wow  she has a beautiful body  sad	pos
some of the photoshop isnt even done well her body looks completely fake  also her natural body looks far more beautiful than the one shes trying to push	pos
damn thats obvious  sad she feels the need to do that despite being so tiny	neg
i dont get it her waist is already soooo small	neg
imagine having that tiny waist and tummy but thinking you need filters  what hell it must be in her brain	neg
the first pic in series 10 out of twelve	neg
oh i actually feel terrible for her  this makes me sad  shes so small already  i wish her the best and better mental health  bd is the worst	neg
the mom looks like a disney villain thats trying her hardest to not look like a villain  the smile looks forced and unnatural	neg
people always mistake us for sisters  the mom probably	neg
whats up with the necklaces	neg
both pretty in rl just rougher looking  i can tell its the same people at least	pos
i only saw one of their videos where the mom was birching about the daughter leaving for college  i hope she gets away and finds herself  the emotional incest is deeeeep	pos
the daughter is going to have a mental breakdown when the mom dies for sure  cant imagine that identity crisis	neg
the editing on the guy in last one is mad skills	neg
the mom is an absolute crazy person  she has two other daughters but treats them like second class citizens only for her to reside so far up this daughters ass thats they even bathe together  its gross	neg
dead eyes black eyes like a dolls eyes	neg
she aged thirty years in the last photo	neg
these people must be so unhappy that you cant filter other peoples pictures  edit uh oh  i just had a horrible idea for a new feature  using facial recognition the app could apply whatever filters you like to your own face  when detected  in other peoples pictures so you never have to see the disturbing reality  and for a premium subscription that configuration could be universal across the platform applied to other peoples views of those pictures	neg
ahhhh the daughter will never be royal in those unfiltered photos	neg
whats wrong with looking human	neg
pic 4 of the mom is quite terrifying	neg
best of luck to the person who tries to marry the daughter  i can already picture mom showing up to the wedding wearing the exact same dress and making the photographer takes thousands of pics of her and the bride	pos
these women are on a reality show that ive seen a few small clips of and this young lady needs all the support and love in the world  the mother is absolutely unhinged and needy in a way that is abusive	pos
they would both look so much better without those gaudy necklaces and clothes  the pink dresses are like 00s prom  great bone structure and real life pretty unnecessarily heavy makeup	pos
something about her reminds me of my own mom and that is      not good	neg
they both deserve better hair products and mom needs to get a fucking grip  her daughter is prettier without the filter  my goodness	pos
have you watched smothered on tlc theyre on the newest season  and the mom is insane	neg
it should be illegal for companies to edit beauty product ads  how is this not false advertising	pos
lmao  then my poor daughter wants to buy all these products to help her skin  so sad	neg
wow  this makes me feel so much better	pos
maybe its photoshop maybe its maybelline	neg
you can tell shes wearing full coverage foundation on the add pic  smh	neg
didnt even recognize her until the second pic	neg
the biggest problem is is that her skin is still beautiful and healthy in the real photo  that is the photo  maybe not the face hehe  that should have been used  that is what skin looks like	pos
i tell my niece that these are not real results  even plastic wont fix some things and it wont last	neg
this brand is absolutely amazing and the triple lipid restore has changed my life      but this is false advertising not to mention shes what maybe 25 why would they use someone so young edited to remove identifying names	pos
thats not skincare that is camouflage skincare should improve your bad skin not hide it  or she uses so many of those chemicals that the result is bad skin	neg
she is pregnant right now which could explain the change in skin  im not defending the ad if it is photoshopped but just want to point out that pregnancy can cause break outs	pos
the unshopped pic her skin isnt bad    ive seen worse in the industry  they shopped her lips smaller maybe the fillers were too much	neg
please tell me this isnt vitamin c serum	pos
so glad you posted this  its getting out of hand with celebrities l	pos
ive used these products since a while   there are some that in my opinion are really impressive in the results h  a  intensifie ce ferulic and the age  ha intensifier youll see the results in just 2 weeks skin is more hydratated filler and fine lines disappear  its really a good product	pos
stuff like this is the reason why people on so many skincare subreddits look at their every little pore and wrinkle with a magnifying glass and ask what they can do about it  smh	pos
i just wanna know what the secret is to getting makeup to look so natural and dewy  is it finding a perfect shade match is it using a specific product or tools mine never looks so smooth and even	pos
i cackled a full aha hahaha when i scrolled over to the second picture i hate the internet	neg
her face changed because she used that serum      s	neg
woof  i use this product and this makes me not want to anymore	neg
why are all these women greedy bitches where are you looking greedybitches  com	neg
all women want is sugar daddies  he exclaimed scrolling angrily through the list of sugar daddyseekers on the sugar daddy website	neg
says female like a damn ferengi   wonders why women are able to see his red flags a mile off	neg

i just dont understand how anyone can think that guy is anything but a mouth breathing manchild  theyre so fucking stupid  they hate women so much its beyond weird  this guys views on women would naturally make it really really really hard for him to find a good one that wants to be subject to his bullshit for the rest of her life so i totally believe him when he says its impossible to find a woman these days i believe that that is his experience  he just doesnt realize that hes his own worst enemy  edit sorry this idiot is just pissing me off  the indignation of how do you get a wife ethan as if thats some kind of gotcha  marriage rates are up and divorce rates are down   i just hate that young boys are subject to this kind of content and its seriously poisoning minds	neg

fresh and fit are human scum	pos
what grinds my gears the most about these kinds of dudes is that they create a whole identity and income stream out of saying that women arent wife material while they themselves arent husband material and try to teach other men how to not be husband material  complains about women having too many sex partners    talks about how good they are at sleeping with women try to teach other men how to sleep with more women  sounds like youre part of the problem  complains that women are gold diggers    are themselves materialistic present their greatest asset as their wealth try to teach other men that their greatest asset is their wealth are obsessed with making more money and apparently specifically seek out sugar baby relationships    yeah no wonder all the women you attract are supposedly materialistic you are too and like attracts like  complains that women dont want a traditional relationship or adhere to traditional values    refuses to commit be loyal or uphold the masculine side of that traditional family  unless it has to do with money then they think its really important for a man to be a provider but they also dont want a woman who needs to be provided for cause then shes a gold digger	pos

it felt really bad when he said his feelings got hurt  like hurt my heart bad	neg
i was once chatting in game with some friends and one was quite young and made a comment on how its weird that some trans ppl who get top surgery dont get nipple grafts i then explained that for some they didnt care got them tattooed on or it was a cost issue cost issue  yes some places will cost you quite a bit to have the nipple grafts after the mastectomy as trimming the nipples to be smaller and more masculine is time consuming and theres no guarantee youll get full sensation back so for trans ppl who arent hugely concerned with nipples in the first place  and dont utilize them sexually etc   its a lot cheaper and easier to just    get a tattoo or move on it really blew this guys mind and he was kinda amazed that ppl transition knowing it isnt perfect but they just wanna feel more comfy in their bodies and are making the most of it that said the bro in the op has been giving me crazy gender envy i cant watch him im so jealous lmao  good for him tho frfr	pos

i once had to hire a very well qualified applicant who happened to be a trans man  and the only reason i knew that he was trans was because i was hiring for a cdl driving position which required me to obtain and verify their drivers license  and although this individual had completely transitioned and was absolutely passible as a man for whatever reason he had never bothered to go through the process of changing over his drivers license from identifying him as tiffany last name instead of aj last name as he was currently known  so doing my normal due diligence i had to ask about that because the namegender didntt match up  he was very up front and to the point in telling me that he was trans and had not bothered to update his license with the state because the state made that process so difficult that he decided to give up on it and just leave his license as is which was fine by me  but because id never been trained on this kind of situation nor had i ever encountered it and because i wanted to stay on the right side of the law on law on it i decided to have a meeting with my boss and the company hr person  who would presumably know the law  before i moved forward  my boss to his credit said if hes qualified enough for you for this position hes qualified enough for me so go ahead and hire him  lori our super anal to the law but also super christian to the lord hr person said i dont personally agree with their lifestyle choices but there is currently nothing in the law that would prevent us from hiring this person  she refused to say the word him   aj turned out to be a great employee  lori eventually quit without notice and wouldnt tell us tell us where she was going because as it turned out she took a job with a company we often partnered with  and then she quit without notice on them a few months later because yeah christian or not she was  a piece of shit person  lori was an asshole  dont be like lori kids	pos

her empathy voice is creepy  its giving vibes of someone trying to make themself cry but cant while looking directly at you  i hate it  i hate it  i hate it	neg
dont be fooled when they call this embarrassing creepy or disaproved of   there is a 0 chance that they pulled her name out of a hat and let her make a speech without proofreading it several times before approval  they know what the message was they approved sending it out and now that its being shit on theyre trying to distance themselves  dont let them  this is who they are	pos
shes so breathy when she speaks it reminds me of voldemort speaking parcel tongue	neg
its worse than that if her partys position is to keep these true asylum seekers out of the us because if it were her party of today this lady would be left in mexico and not allowed into the us and saved from her horrible situation  this republican party of today would call her a criminal or a drug mule and keep her out    republicans are the fakest fucks on the planet  and sorry but you know some right wing dude is jerking off to that overly heavy breathing asmr audio    theyre so creepy	neg
its on democrats to get this in the news as much as possible  republicans have a very affective ability to create echo chambers through fox entertainment and their other information platforms  they will only hear what she said and repeat it to their base who will never seek the truth  its all well and good for us democrats to understand they are lying its a whole different story to be able to convince independent voters to see through the lies  i hope this gets pushed on the right platforms and makes people vote from an educated place of understanding	pos
i really love this lady  on the one hand rape is so terrible and awful you guys     i mean yeah 100 im with you on this  also this lady lets all vote to make the convicted rapist our president again     and suddenly im like just like    wait what where did that come from	neg
the only woman ive ever talked to who came across the border came with her three daughters ages 16 14 and 12  the sixteen and fourteen year olds had been raped by cartel members  a few days before she left home to come here they had both been raped by more than one person and as the thugs were leaving one of them remarked next time well include your little one  so she left	neg
fundamentally dishonest  goes beyond misleading is a pastime for a sizable portion of ppl  until that gets taken care of its forever like fighting against an ocean of foolery	neg
another thing that she said during this rebuttal was that the border crisis was caused by joe biden and his policies  but that is also blatantly untrue  the crisis at the border has been going on for decades and has spanned multiple administrations  both republican and democratic   the really disgusting thing is that there was an actual bipartisan deal to make the first real attempt to address immigration that we have seen in years  but it was scrapped because the orange guy didnt want biden to have this win because it might help him get reelected  so the gop is fine putting on a big show and saying that we need immigration reform    but only if they are the ones who get credit for it	pos
her poorly acted emotions are painfully obvious  this woman oozes i dont actually give a fuck about america	neg
am i supposed to do the surprised pikachu face now is this surprising to anyone this is who they are	pos
watching katie britt speak is unsettling in a way i struggle to describe  its like an uncanny valley thing like shes an automaton or a lizard pretending to be a person pretending to express genuine human emotions  not sure where the gop finds these fucking sociopaths	pos
my thing is of they have such a big problem with the cartel and sex trafficking they should welcome these people  the victims  into the us for safety  but they dont  because they dont actually care	neg
katie britt is an absolute pos alabama republican senator liar with a dirty car	neg
southern democrats  get your idiot republicans under control	neg
who would have thought that she lied	neg
anyone else notice how much she randomly smiled while talking about an immigrant getting raped	neg
its just weird how these people are so ridiculous	neg
obama comes from chicago earns a law degree works as a community administrator with underprivileged people worked and taught as civil rights laws and people call him a liberal elite  trump literally is born a to a rich daddy with a multimillion dollar new york real estate business summer homes never helps a single person and literally gets sued multiple times for literally screwing over small businesses discriminated against people of color trying to rent or buy properties declared bankruptcy more than once and he is considered a genius businessman and champion of the people  but this has nothing to do with race in america	pos
man i kiss the days of obama  if nothing else but for the clarity and ability to speak well and articulate a complete thought	pos
canadian here but i just simply dont understand how trump is in any way eligible to be president again  someone with a misdemeanour charge has trouble getting a job at walmart how can someone with multiple federal charges against him even be considered how is it not just automatically disqualified end of story i dont understand	neg
its weird to think that a 62 year old barack obama who hasnt been in office for seven years would be seen as the youthful modern option if he could run today	pos
roast this morherfucker  dont try to debate him	neg
lolll the man got out of being drafted for the vietnam war i think it was so not really a business guy or facts guy or working class guy and also not a patriotic guy who gives one fuck about serving his country  being a rapist sexist racist theyre just icing on the cake	neg
this is the thing that baffles me about trump and a few other recent republican presidents is them somehow being this middle class champion   they were born into high society and never worked an honest day in their life  their entire dynasty is built upon the broken backs of people like us  but somehow in towimg the party line people convince themselves that people like trump will stick up for them	pos
obama is not  my favorite president but you cant deny his logic here  trump is proud of how he takes advantage of others and the working class far right thinks this is a good thing for them its such a weird take	pos
if donald trump is your guy then who are you	neg
why is usa delivering two senile old men to run the whole country is that all usa got	neg
last time donald was working for others his last name was duck	neg
i miss obama he wasnt perfect but at least he was a good man who cared about his people	pos
i miss hearing him speak	neg
as a republican i hate that walking orange emoji clown	neg
that weird feeling when you almost cry because of how much you miss watching obama speak    and youre canadian	neg
the 2016 election cycle democrats completely passed over a ton of the rural working poor and the rust cycle people in those key battleground states and took them for granted and ignored them  bill clinton warned this was a mistake of hillarys campaign as well as many others and the advice was ignored  trump took advantage and has held an iron grip  bernie attempted to lock those people down and the dnc insured he was not going to be a viable candidate	neg
republican dont care no dems will run my country thats it  you could literally show a video of donald trump murdering children and i still think the majority would still vote for him cause they are so obsessed with their team and think joe is going to somehow make them poor even though if they havent been poor cause of joe  their taxes have actually gone up cause of trump helping the rich  its asinine	neg
man do i miss having an articulate and respected president	pos
god i miss obama he can actually form intelligent sentences seems interestedbelieves in what hes saying  its wild that were having to decide between a literal fraudster and a dude whos like 80 and should be retired by now	pos
shockingly coherent and visionary when you compare him to what the orange antichrist has become	pos
if the shit about his son hitting dudes car is true this is blatant harassment  the sheriff probably doesnt want to pay the damages son is probably not insured so the guy getting pulled over wants the sheriff or his son to pay the damages	neg
dude has so much shit on his vest im not entirely sure theyre even a cop	neg
i would absolutely not trust this guys a police officer  so creepy	neg
this guy either couldnt get in the military so hes pretending he is or he got in and its the first thing he tells someone when he sees them	pos
if i got pulled over by this guy id assume he was a fake cop	neg
was he really a cop	neg
no badge no cop	neg
where is this if you are going to post  give the sheriff department	neg
any cop who displays a punisher logo should immediately be stripped of their job and barred from policing	neg
theres no way hes any kind of cop  hes wearing an expensive and dangerous costume	neg
deputies generally cannot wear a beard  has changed in a lot of places  no badge identifying statecounty no duty belt  unless i missed it but wtf  all the weird shit all over his stupid vest the clothing doesnt look like duty issued stuff either there are so many red flags i would not engage with this person  hes got to be either off duty or not a deputy at all	neg
this dude is not a cop	neg
this guy isnt worthy of being a hall monitor let alone a police officer	neg
does this guy really need all that gear  what a douche	neg
he got a black knife ready to go  he didnt wake up today to take prisoners	neg
is it customary for a police officer to wear a large hunting knife on the front of their vests attached by what an appears to be a magnet	neg
how is it legal to where punisher shit on uniform might as well wear an elephant thats seriously real fascist shit right there	neg
this guy would own slaves if he could  no doubt	neg
fyi so people dont get in to trouble  winding down the window is a lawful order in most states  i agree its absurd but its considered an officer safety thing   passengers do not need to show id in any state unless the driver is being arrested and the police dont want to tow the car in reality this translates in to they have a way to make demanding id from passengers enforceable if they are arresting the driver  cops can also lie to you and for some reason frequently do regarding identification requirements they know the law doesnt let them but dont have to tell you that   in all states cops do not have to identify themselves to you  most departments require it per policy but thats got basically no teeth to make them   if you are dealing with a terrible cop still defend your rights but recognize the correct time to address them violating your rights is after the encounter  no you cant search my car and i am not going to wait an hour for a dog if they dont let you leave then dont turn it in to fleeing  you defend your rights in court andor complaints   if its a sheriffs department you are not familiar with tread carefully  sheriffs have way more problems with corruption and misbehaving deputies because they are nearly always subject to much less oversight than the police	neg
yeah i watch a lot of the sovereign citizen videos to laugh at them and theyre stupidity but like i commented on the youtube comments for this one i just got douche vibes so bad from that cop  like he wasnt even acting professional at all he didnt even speak like a cop and i got the feeling like there was some missing context here  like the potential that this cop might have been harassing this guy previously nobody in the comments agreed with me	pos
she looks this incredulous because someone asked her to think  thats a fire line to end it off with  this dude is legendary	neg
that was a lucid and wellthought out analysis  sadly it wont go viral for the same reasons that reactionary videos do go viral  nobody has an attention span beyond that of an ant  people just let 20 second clipped outofcontext reactionary videos reaffirm the biases that they already have and of course they do because nobody bothers to challenge their biases  that said i hope anyone reading this actually took the time to watch the entire video instead of watch just the first 60 seconds  he makes some good points	pos
well done	pos
great analysis at the end but the video at the beginning is still horrible  she couldve delved into any of the things the guy at the end brought up but instead she actively chose to talk about citing sources and writing theses as examples of white supremacy	pos
im a 44 year old man and its fucking wild and uncomfortable to have my unconscious bias held up to my face  holy shit  that was a powerful video  im not sure what i think on the whole subject yet im going to have to let this marinate but my initial response is embarrassment shock anger and defensiveness  thats so cool  always have to keep learning right	neg
dont all languages have what you would call a correct or academic version theres the version or versions every body uses on a daily basis and in normal everyday conversation  then theres the formal version thats used in the professional and academic realm	neg
hes not wrong but its a bit of an oversimplification to say its purely racist  white southerners are viewed as stupid wrong or uneducated when they speak non academic english  shit i went to college in texas and found myself falling into the same kind of thought processes every time one of my professors said they were fixin to give out homework  even something as simple as an accent does the same thing  people view someone with an accent as dumb or stupid for not speaking properly while completely glossing over the fact that that person is conversing with you in a language not their own  the racial inequalities certainly crank this kind of language judging to max but its wildly oversimplifying to say its just racially based	neg
genuine question for anyone willing to help me understand how my brain is working  incorrect grammar and speech does annoy me but ive never really considered it a racial thing  im pretty well educated and am myself an educator  undergrad college level sciences sociology humanities  most of my examples come from undereducated white people  personal list of pet peeves i forget rather than forgot dont have none  isnt this a double negative leading to the opposite meaning from what theyre trying to say  i could care less  again literally the opposite meaning from what theyre trying to convey  the libary vs  library example does annoy me since were pronouncing it incorrectly from how its spelled  the aluminum  us  vs  aluminium  uk  example didnt make sense to me either since its spelled differently  i also teach critical reading skills for grad school exams  we go over the importance of contrast key phrases like however and how they can help you interpret complex passages by recognizing that whatever comes after the contrast phrase is directly opposing what comes before  it makes things like philosophy easier to comprehend  and get questions correct on the test  i understand there are systemic racial biases in the education system and institutions but my first thought always goes to literacy communication skills and socioeconomic status first rather than race  i assume someone hasnt put in the time or effort to learn these conventions but with practice and training they can  whereas race implies theres nothing you can do to improve since its the way you were born which i dont believe  were 99  9 identical when it comes to our dna  were all the same deep down  whats going on here am i way off base is there some validity to my experience  assumption for context i grew up in the us southwest with a lot of hispanic friends and lower income white friends  ive also received the most formal education compared to my immediate friends and family  idk if that makes a difference when evaluating this  thanks in advance to anyone willing to read all that	pos
lol  conservatives dont understand what dialectical means	pos
how can citing your sources be racist forgetting where it started or who started it  in order to uphold academic integrity it is vital that you reference where you have used others ideas to distinguish them from your own  how the hell is that racist	neg
i am not sure if correcting a word pronunciation is necessarily racist  i understand the point and i agree  as a white person i have been corrected for pronunciation from my elders several times  i have been corrected for liberry before  i was corrected very publicly for my mispronunciation of fo paux and i am not french  i also am fluent in american sign language  if i missign i am corrected  i am learning ancient and modern greek  if i mispronounce a word i am corrected  i dont think this is inherently a racist thing  perhaps i am looking at this too innocently  i love looking at how language has evolved since protoendoeuropean roots  for example a good difference would be the american word schedule and the british schedule was because of the french invasion of england  english adopts words from other languages which is why it is so complex  the british pronounce the sch the french way and americans adopted the greek chi  if i go to england and pronounce it the american way i am wrong because linguistics evolved differently and i am sure the british would correct my mispronunciation  communication is our strength in this world  learning how to properly communicate with others will reduce confusion and misunderstandings  while i personally know that i need a ride to the store to get pants means something completely different in the uk others may not  academic speak also eliminates the white people from the deep south  arguably those are the same people who would feel the most passionately about having a language litmans test  if i shake my head and say nay and you are from greece is it considered consent in america	pos
yeah  always how it goes  malicious incompetence  intentional ignorance  antiintellectualism  a pillar of reactionary politics	neg
this is called descriptive and prescriptive english and is debated amongst many english scholars and has done for years  people who speak standard english are obviously going to be seen more positively than those that dont this really has nothing to do with the colour of peoples skin because it is a known and very relevant debate that has gone on for years and years since early english has formed from the germanic language tree  in modern day it relates to the use of things like uninterested and disinterested although both seem as if they are synonymous they actually arent and if you are in a certain academic environment no matter what your skin colour or natural dialogue is you want to be using a prescriptive approach to the way you use english  as much as people dont want to hear it there are a lot of indian english scholars who manage to excel within the language yet have very strong accents and differentiating dialogue but when needed they speak and write in standard english i have met many indians who have gone very far in english language academia so i just do not believe in the uk at least that someone of black decent is disadvantaged just because they are black  that makes no sense and i know many fellow black students who speak far better english than i do  of coarse people will view someone who speaks in standard english of higher intelligence than those that dont surely that is not hard to work out why  the issue is exactly the same for white people as it is for any other race if you take a descriptive approach to the language you will be viewed lower down than someone who speaks grammatically correct	pos
i stuck with it the entire way the kid is like 80 right  he is right in everything he said  however the teacher at the start either did not understand the book or is poor at expressing the contents  the topic of transition words does fit the narrative  however  yes love that word  she does say sources and thesis and doesnt explain why they are wrong  and i disagree heavily with that point  to me the structure of an essay is not white it is white made and it is white refined  however it is a natural progression of storytelling from all forms of culture  a small intro with leading facts and characters a larger deeper journey into those facts and characters a conclusion to facts and characters and then sources of facts if meant to illustrate data  this is just how stories evolved and it is how we structure because it makes sense and is easy for all to follow  what i am saying is i find all parties correct except the teacher  she explained it poorly and it confused others and she had some points i do find incorrect and others id say are fine	pos
yeah this is bullshit  having an established system of grammar is not racist  and what about other dialects	pos
heres why this is wrong im not a linguist but i speak five languages well  going through the process of learning those languages has given me some perspective  language is formalized and systematized for a reason to provide consistency structure and clarity that allows for accurate communication of complex ideas  the teacher says that these rules are arbitrary  they are not  neither is citing sources arbitrary  it is critical to cataloguing the dissemination of knowledge  just because a group of people start deviating from that doesnt make an alternative means of communication equally valid  when i was learning chinese a lot of my fellow students made the same mistakes  our means of communicating wasnt equally valid as proper chinese   and the formal rules of chinese writing and grammar werent arbitrary   the claims of racism betray an intensely provincial mindset  the uk has dozens of dialects  spoken by whites   so does china  spoken by chinese   nonetheless there is a standard dialect that is considered proper english or standard chinese  using slang grammar and words isnt a sign of stupidity  but it is a sign of lack of educationwhich is correlated with a lot of negative outcomes  this is true the world over and has nothing to do with race  an american hillbilly is white and speaks shit english  that doesnt make them stupid  but learning proper english is certainly a good marker that heshe is not stupid  when i hire i require a writing sample and usually know who im going to hire within a couple sentences based on the quality of writing and thought  i definitely know who im not going to hire  thanks for watching my ted talk	pos
incorrect ways of saying things are unacademic though  everybody is wrong the two original dueters are reactionary but to say that objectively incorrect english is not unacademic is just wrong	neg
he didnt really prove its white supremacy though poor white people that talk that way also sound dumb  its more that black people are disproportionately poor and dont end up being taught to speak proper english the same way poor whites arent  all the rich black people ive met speak with proper english    its literally just a class thing	neg
oh my god that first woman reacting is isabel brown  i went to high school with her  private christian in denver co im an atheist i just had a scholarship plz dont flame me   she was my lab partner in ap biology  we used to do homework together all the time in the library before class because we were in so many similar classes  were we friends kinda im certainly disappointed with the career shes decided to have  shes a talking head for turning point usa  after studying bio in college and getting triggered that university science courses have no fuck around room for evolution vs  creationism it gave her a lifelong christian persecution complex and she became    this  she was always a bad person but this like actually made me sad lol  sophomore year she got busted for cheating on an algebra 2 exam that everyone got like cs on  she cried to the teacher and got to retake it and got a b  we then went to college at rival schools and stayed in touch and were mutuals on ig for years  im not shitting you she has always always been a manipulative crappy person  we all kinda hated her  i got sooooo many stories about fking izzie brown	neg
everybody has their own personal vernacular  i say a lot of dumb shit that isnt correct  just because we can understand what someone is saying that doesnt mean that the way they said it was gramatically correct  its like the whole fucking thing with kevin from the office why say many word when few word do trick  because speaking incorrectly makes ya sound dumb sometimes  i dont think encouraging people to have proper grammar is racist  its part of being a functional member of society	neg
now imagine them coming home im an alpha male now mom	neg
this drill sergeant is every wannabe tough guy trying to be hard ever  weakest lines in the world while using fuck to try to make them tougher  they couldve put some effort in from those 10k fees and researched actual drill sergeants	neg
edit they are now charging 18000  from their site the project is 18000  but the cost of not experiencing the project and not becoming the leader husband and father youre meant to be is much more expensive in the long run	neg
heres 10000    now yell at me daddy	neg
did anyone else try skipping to the cumshot	neg
anyone that attends an alpha male boot camp is not and will never be an alpha male	neg
you would think getting 10k a pop he wouldnt have to duct tape his shoe together with red duct tape	neg
hes so shite at public speaking he has to fill every other word with fucking to let his little pea brain think of the next word ill take this knife off my    fucking    waist    hahahaah what a goon	neg
so alpha that theyll sit in a classroom and get abused like schoolboys  and pay for the privilege  oh well maybe they have dorms and open showers to make it worth their while	pos
youre gonna pay 10k and im gonna make sure more than half of you wont learn anything because fuckin fuck fuckity fuck fuck fuck	neg
damn those walmart drill sergeants cost a lot nowadays	neg
who needs something like this paying 10k for being yelled at sounds like a fetish	pos
so i had just looked it up      it is now 18000  theyve ran about 18 of these classes so far and all sold out  i counted about sixteen students so at 18k each thats 288k in pure profit talk about a damn good business	pos
somebody pay for my tuition and ill kick that guy straight in his balls	neg
i know i could be so rich if i would just get up off of my dead ass and put this snake oil in these bottles	neg
ok before i get to screaming at you    is everyone wearing their crossbody clutch	neg
the fragile male ego is a lucrative consumer market	neg
so let me get this straight      they need to pay to be taught to act like a man	pos
it would be cool if an obnoxious tik tok influencer went there and complained about needing allergy meds and feeling overwhelmed by the noise etc  edit it might also be fun to be the overeager brownnosing participant and every time he says something like that you shout yeah  and ill my dick off too	neg
wouldnt it be easier to join the marines or army and get paid to be yelled at i know basic aint the same as when i went thru 27 years ago but id rather get paid 10k to go and be yelled at then pay someone 10k to yell at me for three days	neg
i dunno i have little kids and the reason our bedroom is kind of dead is because im exhausted all the time	neg
not to hate on the content because its definitely a good point but _holy shit_ just spit it out	pos
as a husband going through a fairly rough period with my wife this not only is very helpful but tracks with things she has expressed and i struggled to understand	neg
this is dead on  couples recognize this and work on it before the disgust sets in  disgust is difficult to overcome	neg
i 100 agree  my only other thought and this was a big part of why my friend broke up with his girlfriend  she had emotional needs that he was working hard on satisfying  he was the busy one in the relationship but put in the extra effort  he was still unhappy with the results and she wanted more than what hes been doing  i asked one question  okay so youve told me what youve done for her  what has she done to satisfy your needs he never thought about that  hes a people pleaser and he went through everything to make her happy but she never was  he was always concerned at the fact that he wasnt considering her needs that he didnt notice she wasnt even making any effort  long ass way to say some people dont deserve your effort when they dont intend to meet you halfway  if i feel unloved and unwanted in my own relationship how am i supposed to make an effort to satisfy her emotional needs if you are in a relationship and you feel you need to bend over backwards to make your so happy they will never be happy and neither will you	pos
is no one going to point outs that shes fucking driving whilst making a tiktok	neg
im sure shes right but sometimes its just because people are older tired overworked and fat	neg
this is exactly why i ultimately left my husband  i stopped feeling safe and emotionally cared for  i wasnt a priority and i stopped being attracted to him  this lead to falling out of love	pos
id be curious for her perspective on the chicken or the egg of this situation  i know when my wife and i had a rough patch she wasnt getting her needs met and neither was i  both of us were intentionally withholding and it took a lot of effort to get past our egos	pos
stop driving lady damn	neg
shes not wrong  its also if a man doesnt take responsibility and share duties in the home its like having an adult child and thats not sexual	pos
a fair point no doubt and a valid one  but only one reason among countless that can arise seeing as every single relationship is unique in some way	neg
the core message is spectacularly informative and helpful but the delivery and introduction in particular could use some improvement if her intent is to be more positively engaging instead of feeding the haters for the sake of buzz	pos
been married for 24 years and were still having fuckin fantastic sex  so im stoked to hear she feels emotionally stable with me  lol	pos
women dont feel safe emotionally for many reasons but if youre a man going through this ask her  just ask her how you can make her feel more emotionally safe with you  if she can express it and its not easy because she already doesnt feel emotionally safe then listen to learn and understand  not explain or defend  tell her thank you for sharing and that youd like some time to process what she said and then follow up when you have without her having to ask you your thoughts  this is a pretty simple fix if youre willing to hear her and take her seriously  i know men who dont treat their daughters well and that makes your wife feel emotionally unsafe or the way he talks bad about other women or ridicules her its not always straightforward	neg
as she states near the end she is only speaking from the womens view  she is unable to speak on what the woman is failing to do to meet the mans emotional needs completing the picture of how and why their relationship is failing  so calm down guys  shes not saying its always our fault  shes stating the half of the equation she knows  she said you might not like it because she knew some of you would not understand it and be able to apply critical thinking	neg
wasnt there one study that said the prevailing factor was husbands basically requiring the same needs around the house as children  needing to be picked up after needing constant reminding not being an equal partner etc   and thats why women tend to lose sex drive in marriage attachment styles arent exactly a concrete science either	neg
dead on right  an additional scenario that she doesnt mention is that we are tired  so tired  the emotional labour is exhausting  the daily management of our and our childrens lives as well as full time work and more housework is leaving us bone tired	neg
the content is valid but her manner of speaking is so pretentious and annoying insufferable to watch	neg
this is crazy helpful  i didnt know that there are attachment styles  my wife most definitely fits in one of the categories  even though we are doing well things can always be better  i dont think the lady was condescending she is just asserting her knowledge because she is likely being ridiculed or dismissed online  unfortunately folks here cant stand a little pretentiousness	pos
the last line slayed me  i want a napkin   we aint got none use your shirt	pos
we out  shuts window girl i said ahhaha	neg
never underestimate a father trying to make his wife laugh while playing with their kid	pos
broke as my ex	neg
this is one of those moments his partner probably thought he was the funniest man alive and never loved him more  this is so good	pos
nailed the gum chewing and attitude	neg
this is some bluey type shit and im here for it   love this for both of them	pos
playing with your kids like this makes it so much more fun for yourself  and them even if they dont fully understand  my 2yodaughter copied me and now yells cash only no card  when playing shop with anyone	pos
my buddy is like this with his kids theyre in their teens now and theyre both snarky and clever	pos
ngl that whole exchange is pretty cute	pos
why is no one talking about the fact that the door has a door in it	neg
its nice to see a dad play with his kids for real  most men i see dont give their children enough attention and when they do its only to play sports or games that the men enjoy	pos
anybody else thinks the voice hes doing sounds strangely like mitch hedberg	pos
i wish my dad was that cool when i was a kid	pos
i like an escalator because an escalator can never break  it can only become stairs  mitch hedberg	pos
this reminds me of the inconvenience store from all that	neg
this was awesome  i work the drive thru too so i might use the ice cream machine line next time ours goes down lol	pos
i cant put my finger on it and i dont know why but this guy reminds me of mitch hedberg	neg
thats great man  i had no engagement like this with my parents  father was off being a fuck head i was sitting around waiting for him to never show up  he came back around 8 years old but was still pretty much checked out and those early important developmental years did not happen for me  mother was way to busy being a hardass and trying to keep us semi happy but she was always busy  if your new to parenting please god do your best to keep them happy and not to see the stressed and bullshit of being an adult  3	pos
ice cream machine broke as my ex	neg
when she handed her the wig she was wearing tears  gives me hope in this world	pos
its amazing to me as a woman how much more hair becomes important once you start losing it  i was diagnosed with alopecia last october and this just made my heart so happy for that little girl  both of these young ladies are so strong	pos
what a wonderful soul shit was hard to not happy cry at	neg
well this woman is an actual joy spreading angel  what a delight	pos
god damn shit could make a grown man cry  not me but like a different grow man	neg
im sure we can all agree that little girl was meant for that pink hair  its so adorable on her  both of them look great none the less	pos
well that just warms the hell out of your heart  my god  i had a former student with alopecia  actually how i was first introduced and educated about it    and i was mid30s then   though there are a few instances that elicited stronger emotions one of the angriest i ever was with one of my students was when he snatched her wig off as he was exiting and she was entering my classroom  i have never written emails so fast in my life  to the admin   to his folks and to her folks   broke my heart to see her feel that  her friends got her and went to the bathroom very quickly but she did go home for the rest of the day	neg
im a lazy fuck and i dont like going to the hairdressers  so when i go i typically cut it to either a french bob or pixie cut then i grow it long and i get fed up caring for it and get it cut again and donate  im getting it cut this summer  it has been 2 years since my last donation so theres only about 40cm to donate  i like to keep a little bit myself too  ive never watched a video of something like this  she looked so happy  saleswoman was marvellous  i have often thought about those who recieve my hair  this will be my 8th donation	neg
giving her the wig off of her own head was so touching and sweet  that girl will remember that forever  moments like this where you take the time to make them feel like a change theyre going through is okay and it doesnt make them abnormal or weird for going through it    its indescribable how important those moments are for people especially kids	pos
absolutely adorable  that little girl looked so cute in both wigs  the stylistspecialist is a gem  i couldnt understand why this was placed in this sub so i was prepared to be pissed because the video was being mocked  glad that this wasnt the case	pos
noble peace prize should be given to such people as a life time achievement award  which will put some hope in general people	pos
this woman is a complete gem  i love how she tied her own personal experience into connecting with the little girl as well as letting her see her bald and try on her pink wig  so cool	pos
the headline said her first wig but then surprise twist  we also got to see her try her second wig  love it  no notes	pos
shes extremely gifted at being a person	neg
absolutely love how incredibly wholesome this is	pos
wigs are wild i couldnt even tell the was wearing a wig until she took it for for the girl to try	neg
i honestly wish wigs would become super stylish for everyone  how cool is it to be able to change your hair daily	pos
my sister has alopecia  i was about four when she got her first wig  i didnt understand anything  i remember busting into the room crying saying you dont need a wig i love you the way you are	neg
this is one of the sweetest things ive seen recently  bless that woman and the work she does	pos
the way her face lights up when she shes herself    verklempt	neg
so what happened lawsuit this is at least a year old	neg
these lawsuits need to come out of their own pocket  there are no consequences for these clowns	neg
what was the outcome of this	neg
why cops need continuing education  they dont know laws they are supposed to enforce  how about they buy less guns and educate themselves with all that taxpayer money might save them some lawsuits	pos
i got my identity stolen recently and you have to file a police report as part of the process  the fucking sherif of east los angeles refused to file it despite me stating the law that requires me to  when he asked me who are you talking to about this i told him the ftc he said who is that the federal trade commission he replied i dont know what that is  cops have no idea how the law or how the government works  they have no motivation to educate themselves	neg
well what happened was there a case and if so what was the outcome of the case	pos
are you googling the laws right now my man  love him	pos
so if a cop demands an id when can you say no	neg
i dont think this is a lawsuit unless the kid still refused to show his id and actually got arrested  judge why did you threaten to arrest this kid cop we were called to the scene in response to an underage drinking complaint  we were asking for ids to verify ages  he refused to show me his id unless i explicitly told him he would be arrested otherwise  judge	neg
these videos crack me up  if that cop wanted to he could beat you to death live streamed and theres only about a 10 chance hed get anything more than involuntary manslaughter  we dont have laws  these videos are always just about somehow convincing the cop they dont actually have the power they objectively do  for everyone one of these clever videos theres 100 police brutality videos that end with nothing being done  believing otherwise is pure cope	neg
professional liability insurance is the only answer  make their errors increase their premiums cost them money and stop it coming out of tax payers pockets  price the shit ones out of the job	pos
if this is a college campus some states do indeed have a requirement to provide student id when asked by campus police  failure to do so will result in being asked to leave campus and if you refuse you will be arrested	neg
technically speaking you dont have to give them your id or allow them access to any locked articles  however if youre at your dorm room and the school itself has given the police permission to search your room you probably dont have any grounds to resist entry  just pointing this out in case anyone thinks they can get away with alcohol in their college dorm room	pos
im gonna need some evidence he made any money off his lawsuit	neg
played em at their own game	pos
without watching i know these are clown tiktoks where dudes act annoying around the police just to get clips  super annoying content  you dont even know why they were called out	neg
psa  identification laws are different for every state  please do not view this video and think you can act like this in your home state  research your own state laws  better yet be polite and cooperate with law enforcement while also preserving your constitutional rights	pos
lol    this is what happens when you get a police officer with a double digit iq who is shockingly inept at their job  just remember police lie they lie about everything everybody and everyone  no reasonable expectation to tell the truth to anybody including the court	pos
do that here in brazil and the next thing you know is that you committed suicide with 5 shots to your back	neg
listen cops suck  but law school kids are always annoying as hell  source went to law school   this kid is not going to put together a successful lawsuit here lol  what on earth could his damages be   cops murder folks and get away with it	neg
impatient and annoyed about something good  i like that line a lot	pos
one of the things i love about the new york accent is that you can actually see the accent when they speak  it was on mute and i still knew they were a new yorker	pos
i dont know where they got democracy or america from  he didnt mention either	neg
guy expresses a beautiful universal view of the way the world should be  podcaster  this is the promise of america as can only be expressed by a new yorker	pos
i agree  i became an adult and realized that it was the bullies and the shitty people who seemed to be succeeding more than those who did the right thing and it made me wonder why were adults too  why are we still dealing with those personalities why are we not shaming them do we think they have more power than us so long as they control the money they will continue to have power over the majority of us  this is the main reason they will come up with any excuse to say that people shouldnt get free money from the government  but real world shows that when more of the population has more money they tend to spend that money which causes demand for things which drives more production of things which drives more employment which because the new workweek only takes up three days or four days instead of all week so more people are employed which makes more people happy and happy people appear harder to control  its always about control  they fear what i describe above because it is hard to control that	pos
this idealistic version of what america might be i see america is the world	pos
does the new yorker circle jerk never end	neg
its really not that wild  we have the space and resources for every human on this earth to live comfortable lives  killing each other or war takes up a huge amount of resources and energy  if everyone got along and all that money and manpower was spent improving our civilization every single person could live above middle class	pos
wow didnt this simple statement get complex and divide the people	pos
the way that girl talks is just    irritating to me  idk why	neg
that is so new york as it gets the fuck is it with americans ascribing ideas and sentiments that have been a thing world wide for centuries as uniquely theirs   its not  not even remotely	neg
i notice that he is actually talking about the whole world but the discussion is about the usa or even just ny	neg
the old man i endeavor to become	neg
i mean if you really think about it we very do have the means to feed house and give care to everyone but human greed gets in the way  the housing markets collapsed because landlords take everything along with abandoned buildings being left to rot on top of asinine inflation while wages stay stagnant and low food waste is so unimaginably bad due to the excess food being stocked and bought and health care being privatized was and is the biggest joke to not just at least half our country but also a majority of the world  its all a product of human greed and lack of empathy	neg
hel yeah spread the word	pos
everything can be freeeeeeeeeeeeeeee as long as someone else pays for it	neg
it would cost 340  56 trillion to do this assuming 40k per head  the cost of all these things conservatively in the united states   the gross world product in 2022 100  562 trillion  thats not even factoring in how many people would simply stop working if provided all these things for free  but thats based on living in the us  lets try it based on mexico     its 146 trillion for mexico standards  so theres still not enough world product to make this work  some people are idealists some people are logical  rarely do you see both	pos
omg how do people from nyc always manage to make everything about the fucking city	neg
okay but like why hasnt anyone done it not in any state not one county not one city has this happened	pos
so    whos doing the work to provide these things for free	pos
i am a gentleman proceeds to ignore her explicit wishes if these guys were actually gentlemen then there wouldnt be that big of a problem	neg
he 100 tells the story of some stupid woman in the park who didnt recognize a good man when he was right in front of her	neg
men if you see this happening  there are 2 responses and neither of them are to ignore it  1  go up to her and say oh my god  its been so long  fancy seeing you here  hows your mom doing and then proceed to allow her the direction of conversation she may use a fake name or call you her cousinuncle whatever  go with it  then when she feels safe just let her be itll have been a traumatic experience so she wont always be ok talking about it with a stranger  2  call it out go to her  not him  but position yourself between them and ask if shes ok and if hes bothering her  this is more confrontational but will likely get a response from him of leaving immediately  please dont ignore this behaviour ever  its the only way we can actually make women feel safe  if they see men ignoring this kind of thing it doesnt help anything	neg
fawn is a response characterized by seeking to appease or please the threat or aggressor in hopes of avoiding harm  this can involve trying to be overly accommodating or submissive	neg
a lot of people are commenting about how this video is fake or staged  it may very well be  but i can guarantee you that nearly every woman you know has had a similar experience  if i had a dollar for every time i was made to feel uncomfortable and terrified by a strange man who was just being nice i would be rich  this isnt uncommon	neg
sometimes i realize that as a man i dont share the same reality with too many women  men should listen more to understand their experiences if they care as much about women as they should and likely think they do	pos
its really fucked up  some idiots need a hard no and a brick to the head before they get it  sorry you have to deal with that	neg
makes me think of quote from margaret atwood men are afraid that women will laugh at them  women are afraid that men will kill them	neg
this guy needs his ass kicked	neg
this happened to me in a grocery store once  dude kept following me from aisle to aisle asking for my number  even when theres other people around youre not safe  eventually on the 5th or 6th no he left me alone but i still made sure to have a friend on the phone when i walked out to my car	pos
that is terrifying and honestly it happens way too much  talk to any female and shell have a story about a man that scared her or made her extremely uncomfortable  i had the same situation i was polite to a man he then stalked me through a train station asked me for sex then followed me down the street until i found my friend at a restaurant	neg
this happened to me at the park once  he kept trying to usher me down different paths and i would just step out of the way and keep walking  luckily i knew the park well enough the fastest way back to my car  i just kept talking to distract him and eventually made it back to the parking lot  he knew exactly where i parked and what car was mine so he had been watching me since i got there  it was the longest 10 minutes of my life  he didnt know the area as well and seemed shocked when we were back to the parking lot already  i just told him to have a good day and kept walking and took a very long and weird way home to make sure i wasnt being followed	pos
this guy pulling a dennis  dont be scared come back here  the implication so scary  hope shes okay	pos
my anxiety is through the roof just watching that	neg
ive never wanted to rent a uhaul just to run over someone before now  that poor girl is trying so hard not to upset this predator	neg
one time i was at a bar with friends singing karaoke  this guy came up to me after i finished a song and started to compliment my singing  i was like thanks he asked to buy me a drink i politely declined  i dont drink but even if i did this still would have been a no   he kept asking me and then began to grab my arm to pull me to the bar  i said i was married he said he didnt care and continued to pull me  my friends and the bartender had pull the guy outside and ask him to leave because he would not leave me alone  i had to be escorted out when we left because i was terrified he would still be there  i never went back to that bar	neg
this sort of shit happens all the time  last week i held the door open at the train station for a couple of people  the last fellow looked to be giving me a high five so i went to reciprocate and he grabbed my hand and wouldnt let go  held tight for a solid two minutes  i kept trying to extract myself but he had a good grip i kept saying please let go but he wouldnt  i ended up twisting my hand away from him and booking it  if there werent fellow commuters there i wouldve been truly terrified	pos
i know this probably wont work for everyone and im also a  admittedly rather effeminate looking  guy so there is that but i was having a super shitty day and walking home from work  this dude starts hitting on me out of nowhere and im obviously not in the mood right so hes following me down the sidewalk just like the creep in this video going on and on about just trying to hollar at me so i turned around and just started sobbing about how shitty my day was how i didnt wanna talk to anyone at that moment and how i just really wanted to go home  he literally said ok turned around and left  so i think just bursting out into an emotionally unhinged ugly cry might put them off just enough to lose interest	neg
remember that gillette commercial that a bunch of toxic guys hated because they claimed it made men out to be bad guys  they all need to watch this  my sister has told me that men do this all the freaking time  its insane  leave people the fuck alone  this is why i believe women should be allowed to open carry at all times	neg
i had an old man block my path in the store and when i politely asked him to move he smiled really big and said no  so i rolled my eyes said i dont have time for this shit and walked back the way i came  he followed me around the store calling me a stuck up bitch saying im just trying to talk to you you dont have to be rude etc  i quickly walked to the front where the manager was and told him what happened  there were 2 teenage girls in the store and i certainly didnt want him to do the same to them  the manager confronted the man and threw him out the store n told him not to return  it really upset me for a while because who tf has the audacity to think blocking a lone females path is the way to start a conversation then follow her around the store harassing her because she didnt find him as charming as he obviously thought he was	neg
wait a minute didnt he say he was out of screams	neg
the vote hasnt passed both chambers and it will only force bytedance to divest  will they divest or pull out of the us market is the real question	neg
when i send my son to school i prefer he come home the same day	neg
does this mean i dont have to see this fucking guy on reddit anymore	neg
ok yeahs its kinda weird hes not getting that its not a hard ban but tbh it does piss me off that this is the issue we could get 81 of congress to agree on  i feel like it is just a way for an american company to become the overlords fucking with our generation and reaping the profits  so yeah its aggravating that our country is drowning but this is the issue they can agree on  man is weird though	pos
and he completely misses the point  a data harvesting and political manipulation platform aimed at minors and young adults operated by a hostile totalitarian government is probably not something you want operating	neg
theyre not banning it theyre forcing it to be sold to someone else  specifically someone who doesnt have a direct line to the ccp  so all this maniacal screaming is for nothing congratulations	neg
its not a ban  its a 180 day notice that unless the app be bought by an american company it would be removed from the appstore  it is not a cut and dry ban its because of the ccp and security and a bunch of other stuff wrong with the app regarding its affiliation with the ccp  in fact the app itself got this detail wrong claiming in a pop up add when you launch the app asking for you to basically sign a petition to have this app sustained  they said it was going to be banned missing several major details about what the bill was about	neg
so a few things    1  this is not a ban of tiktok  its a forced sell off of the american portion of the company to an american owner essentially  this is not and should not be a controversial move regarding a major social media app owned by a key american security adversary  tiktok does not have to be banned bytedance    just has to sell the american portion of the company off to be fully managed by a company that isnt based out of china with the same security risks  no big deal this has happened with apps before and tiktok will continue on in the usa just under different oversight   this is a rough simplification point is there is no tiktok ban  2  the complaint about 81 of congress approving it is one that might seem intuitively salient but isnt really founded in any reality  for one this is not the first time in so long that a bill has gotten wide support like this  its not uncommon for congress to pass things bipartisanly they are just usually not big name actions that get attention  on a different note though there isnt wide public opinion resisting this  polling generally shows that at best for tiktok the public is split 3 ways on this  about 30 support a ban about 30 oppose a ban and about 30 dont care  other polls reflect even greater support for a ban  though reminder this bill is not a ban   even among the majority of those who oppose a ban this is not a big issue for most people  very few voters are getting up in arms and changing their vote based on a tiktok ban its not something many care about  also i get people are complaining about congress not getting big stuff done but keep in mind that this country is about the most divided its been in the last 100 years  the people not just congress are heavily split on numerous key policy issues  no one should expect much massive change and new policy when the country cant even agree on who won the last election just something to consider  believe it or not congress generally serves the people and the people are very divided right now  hope this helps clear things up  this guy in the video is a big time rage bait farmer  things are rarely as simple as he has explained them as	pos
can we ban the rest of social media while were at it	neg
this man doesnt have a clue whats going on  not one clue	neg
over the next few weeks were about to watch a flood of narcissists pretending to be civically righteous and concerned when in fact theyre just angry about losing their audience	neg
eastern spyware western spyware	neg
good  tik tok is brain rot	pos
waaah  waaaaah  dey ban my tiktok  waaaaah	neg
i hate this guys videos so much  the most annoying whiny bastard ive ever heard  its a good thing tiktok is getting banned	neg
just over four minutes to work his way up from disagreement to shrill denunciation  sorry but its an infantile tantrum pretending to be commentary  dont kid yourself this crap is toxic to society	neg
dont you think if 81 voted in favor of the ban that there are probably some very real security risks to this shit its been an obvious data mining and ai training tool since its launch  i dont understand how people cant see that	neg
this is alex pearlman  he has about 2  5 million subs  he essentially yells and whines about how everything sucks and the government is bad and no one can afford anything and capitalism is bad  he has no insight as to how life can be better and his content is not particularly funny or entertaining  the only thing you might be able to derive from his content is some carthisis if youre bitter too  there are thousands of people like alex on the internet and none of them are particularly worth listening to  they really only make you mad and they dont put any real effort into making a better life for themselves	neg
had to stop watching when he said when was the last time congress voted on something with 80  thats just bs the last time was 311 when they passed the ebridge act  and thats just the first example and has even more yes votes then this  this is just the only bill this guys cares about but many bills in the house are completely noncontroversial and get bipartisan support even in todays political climate  i dont care about the tiktok ban either way but its super disingenuous to act like this is congress doing something completely crazy for this bill	pos
thats my wife	neg
ok but this is also all kids under 6  i dare you to show me a kid who doesnt do this	pos
then you swap sides thinking maybe they just naturally list to the right but it doesnt help because theyre still walking into you and you end up doing the swapsy serpentine dance	neg
my husband does this to me  hes always walking me into the curb or off the trail  i switch to the open side and he walks me into traffic but thats easier to avoid  but he also kicks me under the table  we were at a huge booth enough for 8 people  i was sitting way to the wall and he kept kicking me so i moved over to the middle of the boothkicking me all the way to the opening of the boothkicking me  he had to sit wayyyy to the side to reach my leg but he managed  he truly is not doing this on purpose  is this the same thing i think he has adhd	pos
i have an antifriend who cant walk straight  what he does is basically correct both of our paths every 5 seconds or so by way of locking arms  so whenever were going somewhere we look like a gay couple every 5 seconds or so  his wife hates that shit because he will do it to absolutely anyone he is walking together but ive known him for more than 20 years    there is no correcting this behaviour	neg
ive been doing this since middle school and would accidentally ram my friends into the lockers  in my 30s i was diagnosed with adhd and found out from my doctors that walking like this is a symptom of it	pos
its missing the part where he continues talking without a pause while the other guy is swimming and climbing out of the water	neg
maybe if the person im walking next to would have some situational awareness and fucking move	neg
my wife  late 40s  and 16 year old son do this	neg
its the adhd walk  i do this all the time	neg
hi im the problem its me	neg
hey its bidwell park in chico ca	neg
chico ca	neg
i had this problem up til high school  had a friend who was a hockey player and he started gently checking me into lockers when i started drifting  problem corrected  lol	pos
im looking rn to see if i can catch my so talking smack about me  i just know that mother fucker is going to be in the comments	neg
my wife of 40 plus years is like this	pos
omg this is my wife all day long   this hit me so hard as i cant count how many treesbushes she has steered me into  i feel seen	neg
my best friend in college would do this on the way to class  drove me crazy  it never even occurred to me that this was a somewhat common thing	pos
fun fact most neurodivergencies come with a lack of proprioception  the perception of where your body is in space  and that causes the inability to walk good  i find myself using walls and curbs as reference points and i bump into people a lot  sorry everyone ive ever gone hiking with this is why i stay in the back	pos
hi  its me  im the problem	neg
two choices were made that i can understand  the young man looking out for the safety of someone he thought was in danger and his older brother choosing to look like an extra in biography of a serial killer from the 80s	neg
the kid did exactly what every parent teacher counselor etc  says to do  if there is danger tell an adult  tell the police  he does so and look at the shit he faces from the very same adult  s  i hope i have a chase in my corner if im ever in trouble or danger	neg
you could tell that cop was getting real fuckin fed up with the dipshit dad and brother  yes this a waste of his time  but this was an opportunity to commend a kid for doing the right thing the wrong way  being concerned about another person and their safety is extremely commendable of this young boy  wanting to make sure that person gets helpnif they need it is important and something he should never lose  while calling 911 isnt the best idea  talking to a parent is  and even if you know where a person lives and what their name is reporting a potential case of abuse to the non emergency line isnt a bad idea  police can reach out to police there for a welfare check  this was a learning opportunity for a young person who has a lifetime of internet encounters ahead of him  instead he gets idiot parents and siblings alienating him and making it else likely for him to say something the next time he sees or hears it	pos
the dad giving fist bumps to the cops is the icing on the cringe cake  i hope this kid doesnt grow up to be like his brother or dad	pos
wow this poor kid  shitty family roasts him for trying to help someone he thinks is being abused then posts it online like hes the asshole	neg
holy shit that kids family are a bunch of losers	neg
based on his family being so shitty in this video you can see hes used to getting picked on  no wonder he has strong protection instincts  grade a human surrounded by shittier ones	neg
id be proud of my kids for doing something like this  good boy ignore them you did well we need more people like you	pos
what a shitty family	neg
huh  nice cop terrible family  dont see that every day	neg
older brother may want to rethink the glasses mustache combo	pos
kid is doomed with asshole brothers like these to look up to  imagine shaming anyone for trying to prevent abuse	neg
f that dad and that brother  this kid shouldnt be shamed for caring about another persons wellbeing	pos
poor kid is being shit on for doing the right thing  he heard someone was in trouble and wanted to help  this will certainly teach him something but we wonder why theres no good in the world its cause its punished	neg
what a shit family reaction to something that could be serious  the real trouble is that it isnt as though the kid knows her real name or location so they couldnt really check up on her  who knows if she was actually in an abusive relationship  them talking crap like what would a 10 year old girl be doing with an ex over there is just fucked  i can think of at least 1 horrible scenario where the cops would definitely need to be involved	neg
that fist bump by the dad made me fucking cringe what a twat waffle  you can tell the cop was trying to make the kid feel better which made me slightly less bummed out about this	neg
taunting the poor kid who genuinely cares about another person in the world is the cringe part	neg
that kid rocks  his family sucks  and the cops were cool     poor kid	neg
that was infuriating to watch but the cops did a good job  funny how the dad and brothers got real quiet after the cop said nothing wrong with calling that in absolute cowards	pos
a psychopath did something similar to me when i was in high school  i met a russian girl and we started dating walked her home from school cute love letters etc  this was back when aim and msn messenger was huge so we talked on that all the time  her dad got on her aim account and said that there are scary men here with big dogs     theyre going to hurt me      theyre biting me the men are forcing themselves on me etc  i was freaking the fuck out and didnt know what was going on  i called messaged back and finally went to her house  it was just her asshole dad trying to see what i was made out of  i couldnt believe a grown man would do that to a kid	neg
20 minutes after the match shell get a dozen messages saying i was just playing lets be friends  can we chat	pos
men who treat women like that are just mad that theyre single  what they dont realize is that one of the reasons theyre single is because they treat women like that  theyve got themselves stuck in a very easily escapable paradox	pos
girls are the worst they are so mean  says every douche bag thats ever been mean to girls	neg
yall remember a few years ago when all those gamers got super mad that someone dared to point out that being a woman in online games immediately puts you at a disadvantage bc you cant effectively use voice comms yep	neg
the plight of digital aggression encouraged by internet anonymity combined with mob mentality  if any of those guys gained any self awareness of the situation realizing the stupidity of the bigotry hed be immediately exiled by the other guys for not joining in	neg
theres a weird new phenomenon of men in voice chat just insisting that every girl they come across is trans  its fucking annoying  edit to everyone saying its not men its boys real men dont say that shit     yes they do     they have  since the beginning of time i can promise you they have	pos
sadly this is common in gaming  im a dude and i hate chatting with randoms  the anonymity provides a safe heaven for idiots like the ones talking in the video  most are usually single adult men that have never been with a woman or who just generally think little of women  its sad its stupid and i wish it would change	neg
whats hilarious is well rounded people dont do this shit   so you know they are just miserable sacks of shit that have nothing going for them  if you are genuinely happy with life you arent talking shit to random women on video games	neg
i stopped playing online games back in 2010 and from the looks of it i made the right decision	neg
i feel like sexism in videogames is not talked enough  especially because i feel like people cant claim that those comments arent real when theres a voice that is openly spewing idiotic sexism and bigotry	pos
i love the thought of them checking the insta after and then hating themselves because shes hot lol  what a bunch of twats	pos
you handled it well  lame fucks	neg
10 min later on reddit females are sooo mean buhu they dont take mens issues seriously  sob	neg
i dont do game chat but when i hear this kinda shit i go out of my way to fuck with the dudes  if its a game where i can kill em ill bully em  if i cant ill trap em somewhere and just sit  this shit bugs me so much	neg
i stopped playing cod a long time ago  apparently nothing has changed	neg
that needs to be played to every female relative of these assholes	neg
lol grown ass men talking like that to a female player is crazy  mothers must be so proud and they are definitely single bros d this is what poor upbringing brings to the table	pos
notice how they take 0  5 seconds to react hatefully to a womans voice these boys just hate women  i feel bad for their mother but then again she raised them to be shitty human beings	neg
sounds about right for these types of games  i never play them	neg
omg my son introduced me to this game on steam where you go on stage and tell jokes  the amount they were aggressively racist or hating women was crazy   one of the most toxic games ever  i think it was called comedy night   i love this game called dont starve together i played with groups of men and they would end up leaving me in the kitchen to cook for everyone while mocking it haha know your place as they went to fight bosses and things  theyd also say uncomfortable things like most womens voices are annoying but i guess yours is okay kept referencing my bobs and ask about my teen daughter  if shes single can meet her etc	neg
heres my check for 18000  please tell me i have balls ___ honestly this is some of the saddest shit i have ever watched	neg
man beaten to death by six sledgehammer wielding men in shorts at the beach    find out what happened at 11	neg
thats a lot of money for a degredation kink  just get a domina at that point would probably be the better deal	pos
this looks like the trailer for a kinky gay porn	pos
honestly if youre so insecure in your masculinity that youre willing to pay crazy money to be abused and belittled by some bearded chode that invariably looks like theyre enjoying it way more than strictly necessary youre the furthest thing from an alpha	neg
i know it is easy to clown on these people for obvious reasons but i find it to be really sad  these men are so distraught about their standing in life that they feel that forking over 18k for a fake man boot camp is worth it  i am sure there is likely a common thread of loneliness envy sexual repression and societal dysfunction that drives these men to pay someone to yell in their face and belittle them  being a military veteran and going through actual boot camp and war i know they yearn for camaraderie  relationships that are forged and deep but they continue to wade through shallow relationships that return little meaning to their lives  they wont find the success they crave paying these snake oil salesman but through continuous selfimprovement reflection and grace	neg
isnt this just the military but instead of getting a salary  for being dehumanised and broken down to fight other humans from the enemies army  youre paying them their salary	neg
my inner bitch demands some ben  jerrys im too much of a bitch to argue  oh well	neg
these are the kind of guys that call other guys cucks but they pay other alphas 18 grand to belittle and abuse them  this is the cuckiest shit ive ever seen	neg
i feel like this is the kind of place where the goal is to upset you until you stand up for yourself and fight your instructor	neg
i would have only charged them 5k to learn alpha males dont exist	neg
i dont understand a second of this  whats the purpose get verbally assaulted and physically abused to only return to your desk job	neg
all of this to feel like a man  shameful  lemme give any young men in here some advice that took me too long to learn anything you do without shame is manly  anything can be masculine  the manliest thing i do is decide for myself what i like and then proceed to give 0 fucks about what anyone might think of that  its so liberating  the whole world opens up when you realize no one else gets to decide what it means to be a man  just be you fully and confidently  thats manly	pos
man think of all the therapy they could get for that 18000	neg
wtf  they teach sexual positions and they practice with each other 108	neg
these people are mentally ill	neg
lol  as an extremely flamboyant gay man this could barely be gayer	pos
so basically theyre paying 13k to have a dominatrix cosplaying as a military man make them work out	neg
nothing says alpha like doing everything some dude tells you to	neg
damn all that to waste 18k and give a dude a free house to fuck up	neg
mrs  delivery driver got me rollin	neg
its real  trust me i am the doorbell	pos
she does this routine any time a man opens the door and theres a woman visible in the house  everybody needs a hobby	neg
you can go to the gutter you filthy pig  i chortled	neg
and scene	neg
this is the way no instinctively hoping to fight the other girl as competition  telling the cheater off instead	neg
do people get boners pointing out if somethings scripted or not	neg
i like her	pos
staged  you filthy pigs	neg
im happy to see that the females once they realized who the culprit was didnt fight with one another and instead turned on the boyfriend  he got kicked out by both girls at the same time and then asks where hes supposed to live like theyre supposed to care about his lying ass	pos
oh this was satisfying thank you  ugh the vitriol in her voice it gives me shivers	pos
who gives af if its fake  i like to turn my brain off and enjoy whatever is going on in the screen	pos
scripted	neg
hope they tipped first	pos
this sounds like it was written for a tv drama	pos
this is the most british thing ive ever heard	neg
after the missus delivery driver i wouldve thrown hands i dont care  the audacity this fuckin loser has holy hell  im so glad the other woman kicked him out too	neg
once again im just here for the omg its staged   comments jerking each other off	neg
her accent makes it so much more brutal  to us yanks it sounds like the goddamn queen is telling him to sleep in thah goohttah	neg
why would he publish the video	neg
do people even care about the mexicans anymore	pos
it wasnt me it was ignacio	neg
hey kid you wanna weiner in your mouth sans undertale	neg
do you think i care	pos
hrgghnn    im gonna mdust    im gonn a sdust      111	neg
you actually love them	pos
whats the name of the music	neg
not funny i didnt laugh  your joke is so bad i would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up retelling me the joke  to be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me  not a chuckle not a hehe not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus  science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but i didnt even feel the slightest twitch  010 this joke is so bad i cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all  the amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on earth  get a personality and learn how to make jokes read a book  im not saying this to be funny i genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy  youve single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet  im so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny  honestly if i put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so i can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff  youre lucky i still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise i would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again  we should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure  im disappointed hurt and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke  in the time that took i was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned but because of that youve waisted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy  now those kids are suffering without meals and theres nobody to blame but you	neg
what are we agreeing on	pos
what did you just say	neg
huh	neg
there is not humor here	neg
was this staged	neg
not funny  get your cringe tiktok emotional teen bs outta here	neg
that blink     savage gr	neg
what song is that	neg
song found   name this side of paradise artist coyote theory album color  ep genre rock release year 2011 total shazams 2115565 took 1  72 seconds	pos
same  and probably not a coincidence they were just posted right after the other	neg
it was two years ago	neg
wait 2021 was 2 fucking years ago i thought it was 2019	neg
im in school	neg
girls were always given stricter guidelines than boys in my school  none of them really cared though  the teachers couldnt stop the masses	pos
i think the way they phrased it is bad  something like your undergarments should not be seen even through your shirt wouldve been better instead of saying you cant wear colored stuff  i can actually understand this dress code rule	pos
appropriate no  should they do that no  i have never had any rules when it comes to clothing whether its school or anything else  in school guys can take their shirts off girls can walk around without bras with a tshirt over and their nipples pointing outward clearly or a girl write bj  20 on her chest  yes these are all things that have happened when i was in middle school	pos
i dont think we have rules even to say we has to wear bras	neg
then the boys need to start wearing clean underwear a change  just saying	pos
no  absolutely not	neg
its stupid how badly they worded that when theyre simply asking neutralwhite coloured bras please because bright coloured bras will show through the shirt  its really not that hard to be a little but more thoughtful with choice of wording   especially coming from the principal or whoever it was	pos
i personally its ridiculous  as long as your nipples are covered you should be allowed to wear whatever bra you like  its so strange how a man walking around shirtless is normal but a woman wearing a bra  and no shirt  is considered suggestive	neg
like what for what reason will someone be omg magenta makes me horny or what reminds me of that japanese schoolroom where girls cant have ponytails its totally ridiculous	neg
they should rewritte it then  with it being so vague it leaves space to ban other types of underwear  why are they so squimish about it	neg
it was trendy for some period of time to wear a brightly coloured bra under a white tshirt which is probably where this ban originated  the logic behind it is probably the classic men cant control themselves if you show them your ankle bullshit	neg
thats not the same    at all	neg
they probably think that youll develop a crush on them  unfortunately some straight people have this mindset that every gay person will be drooling over them	neg
because people are idiots and believe that if youre attracted to their gender then you must automatically be attracted to them and thereby only see them as a sexual object  same reason some straight people only have friends of the same gender because they believe straight guys and straight girls must be attracted to eachother and therefore believe you cant be friends with the opposite gender  unless they are gay and therefore cant be attracted to you   its just really stupid honestly	pos
the old trope that they think youll try to have sex with them probably  my roommate is a lesbian and she has never tried to make a move on me because she is a decent human being	neg
i know its wrong but just mention you already have a girlfriend it will make your life easier  i got the same reaction when i told my besties of 2 years i might be bi	pos
because of ignorance and stereotypes  sorry you have to deal with this op	neg
because people are homophobic assholes	neg
i understand what you mean completely  im in the same boat unfortunately	neg
well    its kind of similar to if i learned that someone i was talking to was a guy  theres just a difference when theres even an inkling of a possibility of romance between you like two straight guy and girl	pos
the only uncomfortable feeling o would have is if you make a move on me i would love to be with another girl but afraid how to react and not ruin the moment	pos
i suppose because they think that youll fall in love with them  which is stupid but a lot of people just think that i honestly couldnt explain you why	pos
i wish i knew  getting outed as lesbian by my old friend group was pretty much social suicide for me	pos
also you can be attracted to someone and still not want to date them  i just dont get why people think that others are so fickle that theyll fuck somebody just because theyre the opposite gender	neg
hey lil bro youre thinking about men  hope this helps	pos
ive seen people legit argue that they wouldnt be friends with a lesbian because the lesbian likes girls and so they must do things in private to the thought of her and that you cant be friends with someone who thinks of you like that  its really just ridiculous	neg
literally anyone can do things in private to the thought of someone  thats just crazy  and in my experience lesbians are pretty respectful of others boundaries sure there are some bad apples though	pos
i have no idea  maybe its just because its  hopefully  clean	pos
im just a lil gay but honestly hair is just pretty i and maybe shower hair is fresher anyways i kinda want to brush it	pos
i dont	neg
shows that you are clean	pos
first instance of seeing a girls wet hair was in primary school i mustve been 11 at the time  we did swimming every week every week their hair got wet and when i saw that i just liked it  cant explain why	pos
as a guy same	neg
nope just literally never heard anyone say that ever	neg
any chance she got hacked or something removing 100 followers at once is strange	neg
because few people will look up the name of a random book they saw someone reading and im curious how many times youve seen this because i barely even see people reading books in public much less smut	pos
because if i like the book ill read it	neg
ive seen so many people say this is something they do especially on instagram reels but it there dosent seem like many people who actually do it  now i wonder if its just the demographics or if the posts on insta and the comments just get liked enough to where it seems like people are agreeing with them	pos
why do women read sxual books its fun and is a refreshing change of pace from the malecentric view of sx that is present in society  why in public i personally keep all my books on my kindle unlimited and read it in the privacy of my room but my friends read their books in public and they told me its bc they get bored so they read	pos
to all the people asking how come youve seen this its pretty common in our school  and not just with girls   i would be uncomfortable reading smut in public too im even uncomfortable to buy a smutty book in print but i dont mind others reading them  as long as they dont tell me about the sex scenes unprompted the exception being when my close friend tells me of absurd sex scenes that clearly werent meant to turn anyone on	pos
ay what about the boi smut lovers	pos
my friend regularly reads hentai on his phone at school  another one has a fucking google doc full of hentai codes  claims he reads it for the plot but like  yeah	pos
to be blunt the men in the books are what most straight women wish they had  as someone whos bi but leads more into men theyre ridiculous but easy reads  and everyone knows you buy books with discreet covers if you plan to read in public	pos
i dont know of this but books are books and its not like youre watching porn or having sex so its easy to keep private	pos
same  this is news to me lmao	pos
its quite common in our school  not to the point of shirtless dudes on covers but people will openly admit to it even unprompted  i literally once bought a promiscuouslooking book for a guy for secret santa because everyone knew he liked them	pos
maybe the teacher was expecting onepiece swimsuits rather than a bikini	neg
i mean when i was in school girls were generally expected to wear a swim costume unless we were on like an abroad school trip and the teachers were too drunk to care  so idk maybe they just didnt realise your school didnt care about these things either way i wouldnt worry about it too much they were probably just in a bad mood	pos
isnt a bikini supposed to be exactly an appropriate piece of clothing for situations that involve water	neg
idk where im from its considered better etiquette to wear a coverup until you are actually at the pool	pos
no	neg
for me personally it doesnt mean anything  i like stories when i think they look cool or aesthetic  many people see it as flirting however  really depends on what kinda person youre dealing with	pos
they like how you look take it as a compliment  usually when someone looks cute  they also just dont wanna make the first move  i do it sometimes	pos
for me when it comes to people i know i like all their posts and stories at least when i check them  also he could think youre pretty too	pos
does it mean anything when you like some mutuals story without talking to them probably not so it wouldnt matter the other way around	pos
when i like instagram posts of girls i usually think they look pretty  but not pretty as in i have a crush on them	pos
trust me if a guy likes your story and its a selfie he thought you looked good or likes you  and you have a crush on him this should be easy	pos
maybe he likes you or is interested in you and is trying to get your attention	pos
sometimes the opposite is true  if i feel like ive been texting a girl too much and dont wanna get on her nerves but still want her to know i exist i just like stories	pos
extremely subjective but you will find plenty of people out there who like thin guys  dont feel too insecure about it	pos
theres no default answer  were different individuals  if you need someone to help you not be insecure here it is  skinny guys are attractive  but you just gotta have rizz man  or like idk a cool vibe  i know it sounds dumb but just stop being insecure be confident be laid back and show your personality  if you cant get a girl to be your platonic friend you wont get one to be your girlfriend  personality is wayy more important	pos
for me fuck yeah  my boyfriend is a skinny green bean and i love the shit out of it  i dont like a lot of muscle honestly and i love his lanky tall body bones and all	pos
imo more than slightly underweight thin no  healthy slim absolutely	pos
depends  if femboy then yes other than that i like them having meat on their bones	pos
yea skinny guys are cute	pos
a lot of those people lurk on teen subreddits so even if the account is empty they probably have bad intentions  its really the only reason im staying on this subreddit but since im not a teen anymore they do not message me  stay careful out there and do not fear reporting  dont encourage it and dont talk to them	neg
if i make an account pretending to be a female teenager then the amount pedos i would catch would be insane	neg
boys also need to be careful as well i got a message from a grown man on reddit asking if he wants to be friends with me and his post history was disgusting and it all had to do with teen boys	pos
ive had airport security ask for my id in 3 different state i was 14 yo all those times  even bartenders ask for my id  im just tall and tired is all	neg
im confused your flair says youre 15 and youre talking about bartenders asking for your id as if it were unusual	neg
having a penis  they seem convenient	neg
no periods  other than that nothing	neg
they get to date and marry women as straights  like	pos
to be able to want children without facing repercussions to your body and mind because youre not the one carrying the child	pos
that they can go without a shirt and its frowned upon if i go without	neg
strength and height  also just being allowed to be into more masculine hobbies with ease and ability to feel comfortable around men its really intimidating in my fencing group despite being tall for a girl  58   to have to face these 6 men who are stronger and can swing faster and hit harder  theyre all just really buff and im this scrawny teenager who has to do physical therapy for a screwed up wrist its hard  its also scary because i know these guys could seriously hurt me if they wanted to hell i could easily get saed as the only girl there  it would take nothing for me to get physically overpowered by one strong guy and kidnapped or beaten or saed id be fairly helpless  these guys are all very sweet and some of the kindest and most accepting men i know its just very hard for me to trust people	pos
im too trans to objectively answer this post  the first thing that came to mind is everything	neg
valid	neg
this	neg
other than peeing while standing up what about a penis seems convenient just out of curiosity	neg
you are jealous because boys are not treated misogynistically by middle ages white men well has it crossed your mind that this could possibly be because they are treated misandristically by femcels like yourself instead  shocker	neg
btw what you mean you cant  is it just a spray or smth	neg
you can    choose to be empathetic bro no one is stopping you	neg
way better for the bladder how more comfortable yes but	pos
yes but as a woman it becomes part of your daily life  i expect to be catcalled every time i go outside which is why i shut myself in most of the time  hell ive been groped or harassed on transport so many times i dont even feel fazed by it anymore just this weird mixture of sad and disappointed that its so normal i barely even feel angry  of course there are still male victims and nobodys denying that but it will never be what every single man thinks about every time he leaves the house	neg
absolutely true this is estimated to be 10  5 of men and of both male and female victims 99 of perpetrators are male  usdoj statistic   that 10 of men who are victimized have a 99 chance of their perpetrator being also being a man  we need to help support and prevent male victimization by acknowledging that there is an massive issue with other males committing these crimes against them	neg
the pullout method is super unreliable because you can absolutely get pregnant from precum  if youre at all worried then plan b is your best choice	pos
never use the pull out method it does not work  plan b and pregnancy test	neg
my boyfriend forgot to pull out once cause of the situation and i realised when i felt that it was warm  plan b is your friend	pos
reminder for when you take a test the majority of pregnancy tests are only able to detect pregnancies which are at a minimum 14 days  2 weeks  after the impregnation  after you had sex basically   so make sure to take one again in a few weeks	pos
i literally spat out my drink when i read this lol  hope your new relationship is going well	pos
it is not a pick me to be comfortable around guys  it is being a pick me if you use that as a way to put down women and seek male validation  i hang around guys a lot and also girls as well  i just see girls and guys as humans with personalities not by their gender tbh	pos
with boys i could not give a f about what they think of me theres you answer  thats why youre so comfortable and more funny around them	pos
stop giving a fuck around girls too  its hard to find that girl group but youll find girls you vibe with  just stop overthinking sm	neg
im only more funny with boys because i dont know how to talk to them and so i just end up either unknowingly flirting with them or somehow being mean	pos
i used to be friends with tons of girls and i felt more comfortable around them then i dodid with guys  i think friends of the opposite gender are just a thing that a lot of people end up having	pos
idk i dont even have many friends	pos
ew no  well at least the majority of us dont  any sub with teenagers is gonna have its fair share of degenerate creeps and strange older men who think theyre gods gift to young women	pos
yes  jk jk  only the people with an iq below 24 think that  aka all pedos and creeps	pos
if you go anywhere on the internet and say youre a 15yo girl youll get that  a space thats dedicated to teen girls even more so  i would have to assume that the calculation done is that its an anonymous service and theres no negative when they inevitably fail but theres the non0 chance of it working unfortunately creating a positive expected value and therefore making it a worthwhile strategy to dm a thousand teen girls hoping for pics	pos
yeah they do and everything else too	pos
no  that seems like a dumb thing to do  dont do it	neg
based on the screenshots ive seen where people have continued to talk to creeps i imagine that their kick out of it is upsetting people and grossing them out	neg
its the idea that eventually theyll come across someone whos desperate enough that will  so as long as theyre not punishedstopped they will just keep going	neg
thats what creeps make you think  on another note coca cola n sprite fan	pos
only with close friends  and still in my experience getting in a shower together is a bit far but getting changed and using the bathroom is ok	pos
we do me and my sister share bathrooms and if were going to at same time we will take together  if i had girl friends stay over we will usually also take bathschange together  i learned that this can be weird in other countries but i am from japan and its part of our culture  its also common to go to onsen which are hot springs where people can go to relax and you have to be naked together  its gender separated and its like normal  so for us its normal and part of our culture but i can understand why it can be strange in other places	pos
change sure no more than like a locker room setting or promdance sittuations  shower never  youre going to get a bunch of yes answers here because the people who do want it to be seen as normal  no hate its just not normal or expected	neg
havent ever showered with anyone but yeah i change in front of them all the time  its not like were staring at each other	pos
none of my friends and i are that close  i saw another comment saying its common where shes from but in my situation both would be way too weird	neg
some people do but im not sure its as common as your gf is implying  i would never shower with my friends  i find that extremely weird  we used to do that as kids but now nah  changing together isnt so strange  everyone is minding their own business and sometimes its necessary  but i dont even know how someone would platonically shower with another person past the age of 13	pos
i dont no  changing in the locker room for gym is the most id do	pos
change sure but i wont ever shower with anyone else	pos
butt naked never  with bra and underwear on sure if were close	pos
uhhh not shower  thats weird  we have just dressed in front of each other tho	pos
so im not crazy then  she tells me like how theyre both girls and know everything about eachother since pre k and its normal and because i have xy chromosomes ill never understand it  it led into a long discussion and she defended her behavior by basically saying this  shes a sister to me youre just never able to understand it because every single girl does this and we arent touching eachother but i have funny memories of being in the shower with her  man all i say is just what the fuck and i dont fucking like this and its causing me to have an anxiety attack again over it	neg
if its causing you an anxiety attack no matter if its normal or not you need to communicate your boundaries and how this all makes you feel to her  if its causing you anxiety normalcy is irrelevant	neg
yeah i tried to explain how i feel and her rebuttal was basically that theyre sisters its normal and then she joked about it  i said i dreamt of her doing gay stuff with her bsf and she says hey who knows she gets all this and she cant resist it shes the loml then i discussed it further and now i dont like it and she tells me essentially that she doesnt know what to tell me because every single girl on this planet does that  i am mostly done with this its like talking to a wall and i didnt sleep last night cause of this	pos
depends  but most still prefer lean and muscular guys	neg
girls arent one hive mind that all like the same thing  many dont even like men	pos
i personally prefer lean to skinny guys  but every girl has a different preference	neg
depends on the girl  i would say that usually fit and toned guys are attractive  you dont need to be a bodybuilder to be hot  girls would settle for a fit dude though     so good on you if youre staying in shape	pos
depends on the girl and on the guy  from what ive seen muscle should usually be on the leaner side ive met a few guys who just focused on building loads of muscle and were absolutely massive and they struggled  though that may be less to do with looks and more personality lmao   but some girls like skinny muscular lean chubby whatever  its all different preferences exact same way some guys like different body types	pos
either i want someone who would be down to work out with me but you dont have to be stick skinny or muscle man just be funny and nice	pos
well from what ive noticed seen a lot of times i saw girls prefering fit people and slim and aesthetic over bulk like body builders so if you just do calisthenics and get an aesthetic body i guess thatd be fine	pos
i absolutely love muscles on a guy  huge fan	pos
i dont have anything against skinny guys but muscular all the way esp cause the guy im currently seeing is really into gym and hes hot as fuck  i want to bite his bicep	neg
every girl has a different type  i dont mind either	neg
true   im the last part	pos
many dont even like men what	neg
same here	neg
is this a joke	pos
no problem  good luck	pos
many or few are lesbian	neg
by many do you mean over 50 of women are lesbian	neg
many are lesbians  check lesbian subreddits thats quite a lot of people and believe it or not thats not even all of us  as i said learn how words work first honey	neg
that would be a majority  i said many  thats got nothing to do with the total or percentages  learn what words mean before you try to argue with them and stop wasting my time	neg
good god do you have learning difficulties stop pulling words out your ass and deal with the fact that there are indeed a lot of women who dont like men  even more so that dont like you  in that case it would be the majority  many doesnt  the majority  year 3 english my guy	neg
maybe youve got what she considers feminine features long eyelashes etc  like a pretty boy	pos
so there are two ways i could think of this being intended  youre pretty because of some androgynous or feminine features  youre attractive in a way that she interprets different to the conventional standards for men and she likes that	pos
probably like big eyes or long lashes or like you have a softer looking face	pos
its a compliment  i usually say boy pretty when i call a boy pretty just cause their a boy but its a compliment	pos
that could be it  ive got quite small round features and i am clean shaven	pos
not so sure about that to be honest  maybe i was just too stoned to pay attention to social cues but she didnt seem very into me  at one point i was tired so i put my chin on my fist and she mimicked me and made a stupid face  i thought it was a backhanded way of calling me gay or effeminate or something at first	neg
umm  that aint normal at all	neg
is it like purposely and just her chest	pos
i mean they may just not wanna show their face some ppl do it with like half their face and thumps up or something just for streaks thats pretty normal  so idk	pos
edit reread the post it says sometimes with thumbs up  my bad then	neg
id guess she likes the attention of you liking her and feels good about herself if youve admitted to having a crush on her  its probably her way of trying to keep herself in your head and make sure you still think about her like that because she feels validated from that  as a girl who can be manipulative that is the only plausible reason i can think of  there is no way id send snaps like that to a guy who openly admitted to liking me unless i liked the attention and wanted it to continue  its not normal behaviour	pos
the question isnt weird  you are confused just as anyone could be in this situation  its better to clear things out  1st ask yourself do you like her as you did 6 months ago do you feel offended that she sends you pictures like this because you want to be friends you arent saying anything may be  so talk things through  ask her in a subtle manner  like you can just text hey   see if she opens up  and tell her what you feel about it  all the best	pos
depends on how the pics are taken  it could be a look at my boobs and it could be a look at my shirt  we cant really judge without seeing the pictures so youre on your own buddy	neg
how is it weird if she has clothes on maybe shes just tryna show her fit lmao  i cant say for sure until i actually see those pics but ofc thats not possible so this is just my assumption	pos
bro how can i get friends like this	pos
she is kinda manipulative sometimes she had me like crazy for her n like super down on my self esteem cos of stuff she said at one point we r friends now tho  that could be it maybe tho	pos
oh idk then  i dont use snap so i dont know whats normal or not to snap but if shes the only person who does it then maybe it is weird  trust your judgment  maybe shes trying to tell you shes into you or smth	pos
tough love it feels gross because theres no consensus on the nature of relationship  dont you think its better to be clear about it if you like her then express it to her  dont worry about the fragile friendship  nature of relationship is more important  is it frendship or romantic relationship	pos
tell me	neg
remind me not to snap you	neg
we have each other on snap	neg
whats your name there	neg
yes they do atleast i do that or reading erotica  story is important i think it is for most women	pos
ngl i used to consume some porn  i wasnt watching them but i was reading them  but now i am 2 months clean	pos
i do but most of it sucks  self recorded and drawn stuff is usually better  and written stuff is a lot better	pos
some do some dont  i do	neg
i know a good amount of girls that do watch porn but its still less than the guys i know what watch porn mostly because the vast majority of it is targeted towards men and focuses on male pleasure rather than the pleasure of a woman and therefore doesnt appeal to that many girls  i personally dont watch it because porn consumption is very harmful and unethical and offers no long term positive effect to the consumer comparing to the damage it can cause and so do many other girls and boys i know	pos
yes  porn isnt a maleonly thing even though it is targeted to men and creates so much misinformation its almost funny	pos
some do and some dont girls tend to like erotic literature and audio more than actual porn though  i used to watch it a lot but im extremely antiporn now	pos
i dont really watch any actual filmed stuff  i dont know it just feels icky  smut is enough for me	neg
i think story is more important for women and its important for me too if its erotica or audio only  but i wonder if it would matter less for women if porn was actually made for women  i bet 90 of porn made today is still made in a mens pov and because of that women will turn too erotica more because that actually has womens pov which happens to also be story heavy  the consequence of that is that women prefer story  so if more porn was actually made for women then maybe women will care less about story less and be similar to present men tldr i think women liking story is a product of the porn environment catering only for the mens pov and so women have to turn to story driven erotica because that has more womens pov  conclusion if porn is more catered towards women i bet women would care less about story  but thats just a some random theory of mine dont know how this would help you or what you should do with it thx for reading ig	pos
thats amazing	pos
yeah i feel the same  its really hard to find any content from a womans perspective that isnt just gay men  i just have to make up my own stuff a lot of the time lol i wish it was easier to find female porn artists	pos
i agree the focus being on the girl most of the time is very annoying  its hard to find stuff where the guy actually does anything	neg
i think its cool i love when guys have something they are passionate abt and can geek out abt bc i love hearing it  it makes me happy to see them happy bc its so cute	pos
lol girls love pilots  i have a friend whos studying to become a pilot and everyones so impressed when they find out about it  i could personally never do it as im already mildly on edge whenever i fly and want to get it over with as soon as possible but i too think that career path is really cool	pos
i dont mind when a guy is a little childish as long as its not 247 and he will still talk to me like an adult  my current boyfriend is very mature though and thats also cool  i dont speak for every girl but this is how i feel	pos
like everyone else has said of course its cool when someone is passionate and dedicated  and pilot is a job with so many perks for friends and family  its also a job that you need to be really smart to do and intelligence is attractive  but most importantly you shouldnt let whether or not girls find something attractive stop you from doing something that makes you happy  imagine looking back on your life in 50 years and realising you let that stop you from doing something you loved	pos
bro who cares what girls think  coming from a girl   the most attractive thing you can do is what youre most passionate about good people will recognize the work u put in and be drawn to you  besides youll be wayyyy happier if you do what makes u happy  dw bro air force is cool asf	pos
nah not childish at all you just have a really clear goal in mind and work tirelessly to accomplish it  a winner attitude in itself   plus as others already said the people calling you childish for this are probably gonna be stuck in a job they hate for their entire life while youre gonna be flying an f15 or something	pos
forget those girls they arent your true friends when i just read the paragraph i thought it was amazing how you were so dedicated to what you wanted to do   congrats on doing so well and good luck for the future man	pos
where you from brother	neg
yeah its up there with engineers ceos doctors lawyers and the like haha  i think ive just watched way too many flight crashed passengers got stranded on an isolated island movies lol  and its certainly a lot of responsibility even with automation of some tasks  even though i want to become a doctor which also involves plenty    dont ask me how that works	pos
where are you from	neg
best of luck to ya	pos
you wanna be badass and pull chicks join the air force	pos
youre so sweet  good luck to you too	pos
please read my reply again look like u didnt get it quite like you dont get yourself educated on facts that have been told from your freedom fighters mouthes	pos
if im wearing a hoodie or sleeping then no  otherwise yes	pos
i hate bras  literally check my post history	neg
nope  no reason to really	pos
sometimes i will keep it on but most of the time i just take it off i need my girls to breath after a long day yknow xd i also dont usually wear one to bed either	pos
hell no	neg
most of the time  i need the support	pos
no never and i dont wear them out  ive only had a couple of comments but other than that my girls are freeeeee edit  also its not good to sleep with a bra on	neg
yeah that sub is like super helpful must have  my bras were literally floating on me band up on my neck straps falling of and cups sitting on my boobs before  i just didnt wear them and done but my mom wasnt very bord with the idea and i did need bras on some occasion to look good and their calculator saved me from a 75a  eu sizes  i think 32a in uk  i went to a 55e  i guess 26dd uk   and now i am at 55g but most girls tell me i cant be more than b cup and rarely listen to the explanation and just suffer pushing themselves in 45 cups smaller and that much band larger bras lol since i found a great size i do wear them more often too it makes me fairly cute in many times but i definitely not wearing any at home and in the summer i am probably braless if i am just out casually or running some errands out if the blue	pos
some girls are just hot doesnt really matter if they have clothes on or not	neg
imo yes  i guess thats why lingerie is such a successful business	pos
absolutely  like oversized hoodies combined with shorts	pos
yes it leaves stuff to imagination and the sexiest thing in the world is what you think is the sexiest thing in the world  kinda why lingerie is so popular	pos
same way your muscles need to warmed up during a workout so does your brain during intimacy if you delay showing everything its better than if you well blow your load before its ready	pos
depends on clothes imo  i think hot isnt really what im most attracted to though i think things like hot cute pretty beautiful are all quite different hot is the least appealing to me  i think less clothes becomes gradually more hot  up until nudity somehow it gets less hot when fully nude   the most appealing look though is stuff like baggy hoodies  for sure	pos
some girls can look specially good in a suit	pos
yes  im actually really weird in that i prefer girls who cover up more with like nicely fitted clothes etc  its just a weird thing ive had since i was a kid  i refuse to wear anything short  i could get into it but id be revealing too much autism	pos
i am a big fan of bikinis  make what you will with that information	pos
duh thats the whole point of clothes  what did you think they were doing in the victorian era people wore clothes to bring themselves closer to the ideal silhouette or some crap  unless someone is particularly bad at dressing themselves theyre always going to look better with clothes than without	neg
well i think clothes show decency and class	pos
this is the way	neg
their pretty looks how they can like cute things and be emotional without being called a sissy by toxic masculinity and how they have the ability to be pregnant if they so choose  not sure why i feel jealous for the last one im fine with being a cis guy but theres something about it that i feel jealous about	neg
ease of the dating scene  while there are a lot of standards against women in dating men have it harder to find a prospective match  no matter your size shape race etc i feel as though men are more openly attracted to women  meanwhile its hard to judge as men who like us	pos
far more diversity in clothes  guys pretty much just have long and short pants available for bottoms whereas girls can have leggings fishnets and a skirt a full dress you name it	pos
being able to orgasm over and over during sex  i hate having to wait as a guy a few minutes if we want yo go round 2 but she can cum like nonstop if i do a goodenough job	pos
yeah probably just their friendships and shit	pos
not opposite gender but opposite sex but everything	neg
i probably wouldve said smth in the past but nowadays im just so happy to be a guy  im actually happy that im not allowed to cry all the time because it forces me to look at situations logically and actually deal with them effectively because i put my emotions aside  i dont think guys are better than girls or vice versa but i am truly happy to be the stronger provider	pos
they get guys waaay easier	pos
not being accused of looking at girls or being a creep  i hate having to always have my guard up not to space out during the day as to not be labeled as a creep	neg
being able to like guys without a stigma   wish i was straight ong	pos
nothing really im satisfied with what i have  we all fill each other in nobody can be perfect	pos
hmm honestly i dont think id mind being bald  i shaved my head twice and i kicked names and took ass	neg
jada smith has entered the chat	neg
so true  btw happy cake day	pos
its one of those questions that will likely never be answered  because guys have never not had one so they dont have a basis to be able to articulate what its like in an understandable way	pos
this one thousand percent	neg
you are so right  it took me 4 fucking trips to the mall until i found a sports bra that both fit me and did its job  whenever i forgot it for pe at school i would just sit around or be the goalie	pos
its something that bothers me a lot shaving it is one thing slowly balding starting at 15 is embarrassing and confidence destroying  you had a choice i do not	neg
will smiths hand has entered the chat	pos
hmm	neg
dont play those stupid games with him	pos
why would you try and make him jealous youre sending him the completely wrong signals over something miniscule  furthermore some people just arent good texters  i could be head over fucking heels in love with a guy and not text him  i barely text my family  if you want him start the conversation clear the air and move forwards from there	neg
so you like a guy then decide to make him jealous with a different guy then get upset that the guy who admitted to liking you stopped talking to you when you  i assume from what you said  started talking about different guys this guy is just trying not to get involved with you because he thinks you found someone else guys dont respond to being made jealous same as girls he probably stoped talking as much because he had something going on just be patient or try to start the conversation yourself	neg
just listen to the fact that youre pulling another innocent guy to make jealous  you know how many signals you must have been sending for to notice speaking less of the innocent guy who might catch feelings for you	pos
you know could just be afraid to be a burden of you when texting so much so for him  and me  the solution is just to not text  also why would making him jealous help you	neg
try calling some ppl are just dry af and why try to make him jealous yall are wasting both of your time i would txt him that this isnt working out and yall should move on	neg
guys arent girls  what makes you feel jealous most likely wont make a guy jealous id advise u to not do games like that bc the guys tht u should date dont play those games also as someone mentioned dont make sth out of nth  if he doesnt text u just ask him instead of doing what u did  u couldve worked it out if he genuinely didnt know it was a problem but ofc theres a chance he was also playing games  if thats the case its better tht nth happened imo dont need that type of ppl in ur life to answer the question in the title no we text unless were extremely shy  but i dont think the guy likes u  idk him so i cant say for sure but ik i wouldnt  and finally i want to congratulate u for being able to ask for advice  not many ppl have the courage to do so	pos
no this means he saw with that other guy and thought you have no interest in him anymore  thats why he didnt text you  just text him first there is a chance youre both just playing dumb games or smth	neg
why would you want to play games like this what does making him jealous really accomplish	pos
huh   dont listen to your friends dont play stupid games  be straight up go up to him say how you feel and see how he feels and what to do next have you ever seen the make them jealous thing work out no  it leads to unnecessary issues issues that could have been avoided  ask for help with someone with more   life experience	pos
dont try to make him jealous thats not how it works  but also complaining about an age difference of just one year is also stupid	neg
cant pretend when this is as real as it gets can ya if shit hits the fan	neg
i have like no experience when it comes to this stuff  i forgot to add it to the post but after he had texted me that i had texting him apologizing and explaining the whole thing  im not great at talking to guys and i rly didnt wanna to fuck things up with him	neg
furthermore some people just arent good texters  i could be head over fucking heels in love with a guy and not text him  stealing the post here but could this be the case with my friend     she has said actually recently that she very likely would kill herself if i killed myself  context i told her that seeing her name makes my day better somehow and after that i said i wasnt going to kill myself even if it sounded like that and kinda said that you would probably kill yourself if i killed myself  that sounds mean     and she responded with that   oh and she sent me a pic of her in a bathtub and she usually never sends two snaps a day    nothing showed expect her hair and shoulder	neg
not exactly  he stopped talking for days and became super distant i wasnt sure if i had done something or not so i asked my friend for advice and they said to make jealous and that it would work  i was kinda just unsure of what to do so i did it  i felt rly bad about it and had apologized and explained the whole thing to him after he had sent that message	pos
then why did you try to make him jealous if you didnt want to fuck things up do you think that was a good plan	pos
she definitely might like you  keep it up and see where it heads	pos
yeah dont follow that friends advice on this stuff  making people jealous doesnt work  it never works  just be open and communicate with him  i know its tough but thats what you have to do	neg
idk it was dumb  i just wasnt sure what to do and my friend said it would work so i did it  ik i fucked up i feel like shit about it cuz he rly is a nice guy and didnt deserve that	neg
i asked her whta she wants to do when we meet  was that dominance a good idea or wouldve my initial approach of would you like to meet or something like that better  and she said iii dont know  does that change your opinion but i asked her would she like to see me even this summer  that probably wont happen because im going on a trip with my parents and seeing my friend wouldnt be private if they were with us and they probably wouldnt let me to an unknown city to meet an unknown person but this is just my speculation   and she replied with yeah if i could  really there was only if but that wouldve made it sound more negstive than i interpreted it   sorry for the use of so many parentheses	pos
its such a broad question  if it was just a boy came up to me and said i have a crush on you do you feel the same or whatever id ofc just apologise that i dont swing that way  if it was a friend and say we were in one of our rooms playing games together and he paused it and then was like hey so i have actually got a crush on you do you feel the same or whatever id probably hug him and then just try to process it and then just have a talk about how we want to go about this	pos
i would reject because i am straight  but there is nothing wrong with being gay or bi	pos
i mean    i wouldnt consider myself straight really but it would depend on the situation	neg
if it was a regular dude i would apologise and say i am straight  however if it were a femboy depends on his feminine levels	pos
its happened to me  my reaction was pretty much as nice of an ego boost it is i aint interested	pos
flattered  maybe awkward but flattered	pos
i had a guy send me a big long text about how much he loves me and wants to be in a relationship with me  ive told him im straight and he was acknowledging it in the text but asked for a chance  i merely let him down gently telling him that im just not into guys  we still talk normal as we have a slightly crossing over friend group and is not particularly weird	pos
i am straight but    if the guy is hot i would not mind making out  i cant talk to people it aint happening	pos
depends how much i know him depends how much i like him	pos
id be flattered    i think	pos
the same reaction if a girl told me they had a crush on me but i had no feelings towards them  be very flattered but also honest with them	pos
tbh i wouldnt be surprised  i wouldnt treat them any differently but id also make it abundantly clear that im not interested	neg
good tbvh have you seen gay dudes these motherfuckers look so majestic  if one of these dudes have a crush on me that just means i am pretty	pos
i am not trying to hate  im just not supporting it	pos
id freeze not believe it play it off as a joke and realize it was real a year later and then id finally apologize for my reaction after realizing it	pos
avoid that mf like the plague  had one chick i hated that liked me avoided her like the damn plague too  if you dont see your problem is there really a problem	neg
i would try to talk to him about jesus or just flip him off	neg
im a bi dude and this made me really smile  that kind of mature outlook is really meaningful	pos
this is it  this is the one	neg
my feminine levels can go from a 810 to then drop down to a 210 the very next day  some days i just feel more like a woman than a man but some days i feel like a man  idk its weird	pos
telling them who i really am it might be your personality  changed it to a light skin guy lying about yourself is generally not a good way to attract people  also light skin guy is crazy	neg
you do realize this is the subreddit where you ask teen boys right	neg
id honestly rather go to a sketchy gay bar and risk getting gangraped or a dui than use a dating app  at least i know the people are real	pos
i get plenty of matches but theyre bad  like theyre just seeking for attention and not interested in actually having a conversation  ive had much better luck on bumble though  tinder is very egotistical but bumble has some better girls	pos
i get a lot of matches but it never goes anywhere lmao  i have stopped caring about the tinder people	neg
i used tinder for about 4 months after i got over my last ex and until i met my girlfriend  not on tinder   i had one hookup and i believe three dates and no second dates  so one hit a month and that probably is above average for guys at least straight guys  my bi best friend hadhas plenty of matches   dont expect a lot	pos
works for me  im like a solid 7 but seem to get matches left right and centre  helps being near a university area i guess	pos
the abundance of men on tinder creates more competition and allows women to shoot up   i dont think online dating truly works unless you are like a 910 or really lucky at least for men   also keep in mind this is not how it is irl	pos
yeah  ive been on a few outings  i dont expect to get anything out of it other than just getting to know people	pos
i do get matches on dating apps bumble works a lot better for me but i got quite a few matches on tinder aswell  i dont even look especially good i just put in some funny or good looking pictures of me and i think my bio was some shit like lets match and never text afterwards getting matches is very different than getting a relationship through apps like that tho i dated a few people i met on there and things went well with a few of them but things never got too serious  im in a relationship with somebody who i was friends with for a long time tho now so i deleted all of my accounts and uninstalled that stuff  edit also why tf would you ask this on a teen subreddit like 90 of the folks on here arent even allowed to use tinder lol	pos
bro the reason you get matches as kermit is because you have a funny gimmick and the reason it doesnt go further is because youre breaking the gimmick  and the last one is just catfishing bro  also tinder actively preys on men and sometimes shadowban them so theyll spend money	pos
i dont use them but i have a friend that has two dating apps he didnt have enough courage to really set up his profile on both one of the apps even had a personality test for better matchups	pos
tinder is used by the severely desperate and the narcissistic  wouldnt touch it with a 10 ft pole  also major demographic here is 18  not the best place to ask	neg
every dating app is made in a way that favours women and makes money off lonely men  who make up probably 80 of the users there   tinder is the worst one among them all	neg
emphasis on the ex part	neg
where do i find a gay bar	neg
yea but are you light skinned it just sounds like youre catfishing	pos
oh yeah    its this guy  makes sense now	pos
only two ages in the teen umbrella are allowed to  you could have chosen almost any other ask subreddit and it would have been a better choice	pos
thats fair  though it was by far my healthiest relationship other than my current one	pos
just asking about what hes doing regardless if its fixing something playing a game working on something etc   just ask him about it  you can do research beforehand and play dumb with the questions you ask but especially if its an interest of his hell love youre taking an interest in it as well just dont ask too many at once especially if hes  for example  playing a game with people so hes trying to get info from them trying to meet an important deadline etc	pos
take interest in the games he plays shows he watches maybe the things he likes to collect or hobbies like sports he likes to do  id be thrilled if a girl took interest in my hobbies music i listened to and other specific interests  just try to observe and take interest	pos
what youve described in this post are very common girl hobbies   what do you consider guy hobbies that would generally be your answer  people find it attractive when you take interest in their thing especially when its not normally a thing associated with your gender  for guys i believe the two biggest ones are competitive games and sports  sports is a bit more for older guys from what ive seen but you get the idea	pos
my best friend is a girl and she does this to me  that and football jerseys  i get em back eventually  shes not my gf just likes my stuff	pos
sometimes i get hyperfixated on a person or object and i have to keep looking at it	neg
he probably just didnt think you felt the same so stopped trying  if thats the case then its highly likely he still has a crush on you  id recommend staring backflirtingwhatever	neg
i sometimes take a glance at girls because i think theyre pretty  not necessarily because i like them  but then again he might have a crush on you  only way to find out is to ask him	neg
maybe you just caught his attention when i liked this one girl me and i stared back and forth all class until we confessed if not he could just be staring into space but itd be easier for you to ask him not in a rude way tho and maybe do it privately	pos
i myself have add so i could very easily go on a trip down my mind and keep staring blankly at anything could be that id suggest asking him	pos
i get like that too i have ocd is that why you do it do you copy what they say sometimes etc  cause he has copied what i say and smiled at me once before and listened to me but not talked so it might be more likely to be a crush than a hyperfixation idk  obviously i hope so haha	pos
yeah its especially with me with people like i have to keep looking at someone not stare but keep glancing and some hyperfixations i try and behave like the person and wear the same kind of clothes and talk the same way    i swear ive never been fully myself cause of it	pos
yes this is so important  even little things like staring back can go a long way  i was obsessed with this one girl in this class and thought i had no chance  all of a sudden she started staring back at me and it gave me the courage to pursue her	pos
do you full on stare at girls you find pretty i dont mean any rude intent	pos
im not disagreeing but he did stare at me in different seating plans and in different situations so unless i look like a dead relative idk why hed stare at the same person in different places just cause hes spaced out  what doyou think	neg
even in different seating plans and situations at the same person	neg
im not trying to be rude but i looked up at him from across the room several times to find him staring at me sometimes with a straight face  smtimes smiling  its not the same thing as just looking lol	pos
yeah i do that  im not diagnosed but i have every symptom	pos
nah i dont full on stare  just a quick peek  no longer than 4 seconds  otherwise stacy would think im a creep with ill intentions	neg
can i add you ive never met anyone who has parts of the same kind of ocd as me	neg
do you still think so as he is confident but doesnt talk to me we sit by each other in class right now in which i think i heard him laugh at something i said under my breath and im well aware that im messing it up by not talking to him  and that anyone would love to sit by their crush  but i dont really care about that i just know that in my head if i talk to him he might think im pathetic and stop liking me  im an awkward person  anyway im sorry for dumping all of this	pos
update	neg
if you dont want to full on ask him out just flirt with him tease him touch him on the arm or shoulder etc  trust me no guy will be offended if a girl did this and he will get the hint	neg
you should text him  he might be syy and thats why he hasnt texted you  if thats the case he might be waiting for you to text him you have pretty good chances with him	pos
i asked our mutual friend  ik ik pussy of me i didnt text him  and she said you can wait but hes kinda a bad texter or smth if he doesnt text thats on him but if you really want theres nothing wrong with you making the 1st move should i still text him even if hes a bad texter ive made the 1st move before but whats mostly stopping me is the fact that he was interested in me first  like if i was interested in him first id start the conversation but it was the opposite  sorry if this is kinda like redundant or smth	pos
i asked our mutual friend  ik ik pussy of me i didnt text him  and she said you can wait but hes kinda a bad texter or smth if he doesnt text thats on him but if you really want theres nothing wrong with you making the 1st move should i still text him even if hes a bad texter ive made the 1st move before but this is the 1st time in awhile where i feel really jittery ig    so idk wat to do sorry if this is kinda like redundant or smth	neg
well if you want something in life you have to seize the opportunity  you should probably just send him a message  even though you may be shy it never hurts to just let someone know that you are there maybe you sending him a msg will be the nudge he needs	pos
yeah do it   some people are just afraid to text or start things especially with new people  im uere thar once youre friends itll get easier	pos
make the first move he is hoping for it  in beginning you probably need to keep the conversation going since he is bad at texting so dont get mad for it  but after he get to know you it probably improves	pos
okay  ur so right i can do this thanks	pos
ive struggled with my weight being inconsistent my entire life  when i was younger i was pretty underweight then overweight for a few years  im happy with my healthy weight and build for probably the first time in my life  the point of me saying this is i could never judge someone for having similar issues  some meat on the bones is not a bad thing as long as your weight is healthy for you thats the main concern	pos
nobody cares about the number on the scale as long as you look good  peoples taste varies but as you describe yourself you dont seem out of the norm maybe on the bigger end of it	pos
i want someone that is healthy and not a slob  i dont care if youre fat or skinny	pos
im  not an expert but that sounds like a healthy weight so i wouldnt worry about that but to answer your question im sure some do but i think in general its only a problem if your weight is unhealthy	pos
something that you should keep in mind for all topics similar to this is that boys dont really care too much except for extremes  most guys will be okay if you have a slightly higher body fat  a bit flat stomach and no thigh gap  hell i know a couple that would rather go for someone like that rather than someone with a standard thin body type  however if you weigh like 8 kilos more than you should for your height thats when youll get a lot of guys not finding you attractive  and in the same vein if you weigh too little and are really skinny a lot of guys wont find you attractive  this goes for more than weight  it applies with height the size of your chest and butt and more things in that vein edit i just looked at your profile and from what i can see you look perfectly fine  you shouldnt worry guys will find you attractive your weight is perfect	pos
ok so yes but not in the way you think  i think some girls stress over this and think that when someone says they care about weight they care about the specific measurement and the specific detail  i have my preferences but i dont care if youre like 6 pounds overweight nor do i care that you have a chubby face  although personally i like chubby girls but thats besides the point   if its something very detrimental to your health then of course i care  you really have nothing to worry about  no guy  at least no guy worth your time  is gonna nitpick about your thighs touching or your stomach not being flat  hell my stomach is most certainly not flat and my thighs touch as well   if youre healthy thats really all that matters	pos
na i dont care     i just be myself and eat as i wish	pos
we guys dont care too much unless its like 100kg  the ones that do care are other girls you tell yourself you are chubby because other girls are slimmer but 49 with 5ft doesnt sound chubby to me	neg
most boys will only care about their weight if it is in the extreme case  extremely fat or extremely thin	pos
i just look for someone who cares about health  they dont even have to be at a healthy weight currently as long as theyre seriously trying	pos
generally no  in extreme cases yes	pos
as long as it doesnt affect your health and mood then its perfectly fine to have people at different weights some people are just genetically better or worse at gaininglosing weight in both fat and muscle  i can gain weight easily	pos
depends  for some guys it can be a turnoff however if someone he really likes you they probably font care	pos
no not really i mean me personally i care about there personality more than looks yes i do like looks alot but its more about you feelings than looks	pos
arent skinnt but arent overweight so you mean do boys like girls that are a healthy weight ofc lol	pos
as long as you arent so far in either direction that its a detriment to your health im fine with it  unless you have some kind of over eating issues like binge eating since i used to have those issues and dont want to be tempted into restarting them	pos
im skinny 511 58kg  need to gain weight smh	pos
i agree  i havent struggled with my weight over the years but id never judge someone for theirs  as long as theyre happy im happy	pos
thats funny cause the norm is an unflat stomach and i think thighs touching  id say shes average	pos
to be fair i hear most people are attracted to thick thighs and larger proportions if you catch my drift  i think most people would probably like someone with meat over their bones	pos
please stop overthinking  if he texts often he likes to talk to you	pos
i see nothing but a field of flags and they are all bright green	pos
yeah it means he wants to talk to you	pos
am a dude have done this yes he likes you hes hanging with the boys and still finding time to text you	pos
if he talks to you while playing the game he really likes to talk to you  it takes quite some level of willpower to multitask that way especially with a game like helldivers 2  if hes sacrificing losing some matches to talk to you he is a real one  same for girls to boys i guess  but like the other comments please dont overthink so much	pos
girls just do that in my experience not sure why but  some i have streaks with do it despite having a boyfriend so its not anything hinting  also you say high school age but that could mean 1218 lol	pos
that being said i dont see the point in streaks why are you purposely raising your snap score	neg
i do it to keep up with friends  like sometimes if i notice something fun in the streaks i see it and say something	pos
calm down theres no need to be so rude  its not like i attacked you personally just an action that you do and i didnt even apply what i said only to you as a single person	neg
nah its alr im just kinda sarcastic abt myself all the time  in truth i am an incel in the technical way but i dont hate women like andrew tate does  i just dont understand women as well as men and ever since i realised that ive kinda just not been able to trust women as much	pos
if he was like sending snaps of his crotch area  best comparison i could make lol  then yes of course lol	pos
nah i think theyre cool  idk why so many guys hate them lol	neg
personally im not a big fan but im not everyone	neg
something small and subtle can look really good especially if it goes with your style  ive seen people who have multiple nose piercings and that is not attractive imo  also not a big fan of septum piercings  but the most important thing is for you to do what makes you happy and looks good in your opinion	pos
ive literally only been with girls with nostril piercings  i dont think its unattractive	pos
i dont find them attractive but they probably wouldnt be a dealbreaker	neg
i think they can go either way for looks but i think theyre impractical  whats it like blowing your nose with one in how often do you have to recenter it	pos
i dont really have an opinion  if you got one cool if you dont also cool	pos
i like them they are mostly very cool and look good	pos
a septum piercing  large piercing of the septum  can be attractive smaller piercings are not attractive in my opinion	pos
id say as long as the piercing is in an area where its not gonna be the main focus on your body then it will look ok and maybe even more attractive  the septum is right in the middle of the face so its gonna draw a lot of attention whereas basically any piercing on the ears isnt gonna be noticed as easily  this is just for me though  i imagine most guys would be the same but i dont talk to folk about this stuff and also youre always gonna have people who like different things	pos
nose piercings look gross and get dirty  not a fan	neg
i dont know about nostril piercings but i have a stretched septum piercing and a 12 mm ring inserted which also seems to block the nostril a bit  theres generally no problem with blowing my nose because the nose tissue is quite flexible  regarding recentreing if you use a plain clicker ring you dont have to recentre it  horseshoes on the other hand are a bit annoying tbh	neg
my friend has one blowing your nose when its healed doesnt hurt at all you barely feel it  you also dont need to recentre it but if its a stud you may need to adjust it sometimes  apart from healing  which if you actually do what your meant to do it isnt too hard to heal  its really not a bother	pos
i disagree here because im definitely not into traditional women and even like goth girls but the piercings just look unattractive to me and dont like them  i dont think my opinion is that unpopular either but i could be wrong	neg
aw  thank you so much that means a lot to me    you seem really sweet as well take care	pos
interesting  i do think that more outthere piercings like snakebites or bridge piercings arent generally that popular but i dont feel like nose piercings are really looked down upon much  im a bit older than you so maybe thats why things seems different to me idk	pos
i think it might differ from country or state because i can definitely see both types of people but its hard to say because its not rly discussed very often  id lean towards the not good general opinion of them but thats probably just my bias	neg
maybe we arent staring  maybe we only look like were staring we may be lost in thought      pondering why did i have that second breakfast burrito     i wonder if i can get out of my chair and make it to the nearest bathroom without farting or at least where everyone can hear it	pos
many reasons shes pretty you like her you just are looking at her cause you wanna shes your friend and youre being goofy or you could honestly not even be thinking abt her when you look at her  boys also tend to fixate on things they like	pos
probably got a random hyperfixation  usually passes within a few minutes	neg
nothing  im not staring at her im staring at the air she just happens to be on the other side	neg
wow she is pretty     continuous thinking about historical events	pos
literally could be anything  the only time when im staring at a girl is when im zoned out and when i awaken to the sight of her i shit myself because i was staring at her boobs or smth	neg
first date more dates essentially spending time with a girl	neg
literally nothing just admiring  this reminds of a time i was staring at a girls jugs my friend took a pic of me and showed me and asked what i was thinking about since i looked so deep in thought  i wasnt thinking of anything just staring at a pair of nice jugs	pos
most likely something along the lines of wow shes really cute i think i might have a crush on her but thats either like 2 accurate because i genuinely am attracted to this person or 92 accurate because theyre friendly and have been nice to me and my deprivation of intimacy and compassion has made me fall deeply in love with basically anyone whos generally kind to me	pos
if im staring at my crush its for one of 3 reasons 1  shes just really pretty tbf 2  im imagining what our relationship would look like if it exists 3  immlost in space thinking about minecraft farm building and new redstone ideas	pos
when i do it im either people watching or in a thought or think the girl is pretty not in a creepy way by any means  just starting into the world i guess	pos
spacing out to be fr id like to find a way to stop it but my classes are boring as shit that i have to just stare at something  most of the its just like the clock on the wall or something	neg
i stare at people in general one reason is cause i realise im lonely and feel as if i have no meaningful connections  then i just go back to sleep and realise damn i like being on my own a lot more that talking to random niggas	neg
i would love to say im innocent but thats far from the truth but i can say when i look at a girl my mind doesnt usually go immediately to sex	pos
i dont do that	neg
nah  my name is pretty good	pos
im trans so yeah i picked my own  jokes aside though idk if its a local thing but theres a lot of people who go by different names where i live  its more common with older people though but its still not strange	pos
im a musician whos trying to figure out an artist name  it may gut be my first then middle name	neg
not really  i like my first name its unique but the mispronounciations and blatantly saying a different name can be annoying at times	neg
well i reall like my name but if i had to change it i would take case well that was hard to guess was it i dont even know if it would be legal tho	pos
im not a fan of my name so i often go by a nickname  im so used to people calling me it that itd feel weird to go by another name even though i might like it better	pos
mine started as a nickname its close to my actual name minus a letter and replaces the first letter with a different letter i often introduce myself and my parents introduce me as it even my extended family have jumped on it  now i sign my papers and such with the name  its my name as far as im concerned	neg
cool pick  one of my favorite songs is called diemonds not exactly the same but similar  how do you pronounce it like if you had to spell it out phonetically	pos
lucky  i used to think that but recently i just havent been feeling the first name as much as i used to  some people call me by a shortened version of my name  thats what my dad goes by and it just fits me even less	pos
its your name youre allowed to change it if you want personally i changed my name when i was twelve years old	pos
romania mention  im romanian	neg
i have an apple watch i wear it because its convenient  i exercise a lot and its nice to track my activity  also being able to quickly text people and see notifications is nice	pos
i use a watch to check the time so i dont have to dig my phone out of my pocket every time just a quick flick of the wrist and i know what time it is  and your dads right i had never worn a watch when i got mine as a gift but after a week i barely noticed it and now it almost feels weird to not wear one	pos
i dont waer a watch  i do wear bracelets tho  a watch doesnt feel needed for me	neg
i wear a watch almost everyday the most part of my wrist that i wear my watches on is a different shade to the rest of my arm  watches are a good way to accessorize and silver watches go so hard with silver rings	pos
i wore a casio gshock with a mi band 4 then last summer i got an apple watch  ive worn watches for many years and you get used to it  just dont have it too tight otherwise youll end up with a nice rash on your wrist  i noticed that certain bands just dont agree with me  its nice being able to easily see the time and my notifications at a glance along do some other things like get 2fa codes without needing to pull out my phone	pos
i dont i dont really like things wrapped around my wrist and i just use my phone for the time because its always in my pocket	pos
no it feels weird to me when theres something too heavy in my wrist	neg
i dont wear one cos i have a phone i can use to tell the time i dont care for having one i cant afford a fancy one another thing i gotta worry about having on me  overall i just think its easier to not wear one	neg
i wear a watch on special occasions  if youre an athletic person or wear more casual clothes i wouldnt wear watches but if you dress nicer on a daily basis and the watch goes with the outfit go ahead	pos
looks stylish and its much easier to turn your wrist up to look at the time when you are in a hurry than check your phone  and most importantly watches make you realise how fast time actually moves	pos
i usually wear a watch on special occasions but then have one that i daily funny thing is they dont work just for looks	pos
i think ive worn a watch since i was 14  i wear a watch to know the time shocker i know  but also because it looks good to wear a watch and now i feel naked without it  the same goes for my necklace and bracelet	pos
yeah i do  the reason being im in college and for a lot of the important exams i have to know how much time i have left  now for obvious reasons phones with clocks are not allowed wall clocks dont always work and teachers dont really care so i prefer having my watch  it is also way easier during cold weather to juste get my hand out of my pocket to see the watch than trying to get my phone out  you do get used to it after a little while so that should be no problem	pos
got my first watch at 8  loved knowing how long things took and loved knowing the time  now ive upgraded to a fitness tracker  i can change music remotely i can find my phone i can pick which apps and which contacts send notifs to it  ones i cant really ignore  so im not worried about like who texted me etc  if its important ill know  its let me not pick up my phone as much	pos
i got a watch from my grandad after his passing  now i collect them biased opinion but wear a watch  i save a lot of battery on my phone from meaninglessly turning the screen on to look at the time turning it off and then back on again because i forgot to check the time	pos
this is the same logic i have i cant have my phone out at work and theres one clock in the building  plus i feel naked without the watch now	neg
id ask him out	neg
too late hes mine now	neg
where in europe is smoking ok   btw i definitely would get ice cream with a girl but id pay	pos
why lol  who doesnt love ice cream if my bullys asked me to go get ice cream i would	neg
nah thats chill  i also enjoy clubbing and some za from timetotime but i also appreciate the chill moments as well  going for ice cream sounds fun  go for it	pos
i wouldnt say its lame at all but why would you go after this guy he and you have such different likes and hobbies	pos
i mean its better than the cliche wanna get a drinkcoffee together imo  getting ice cream sounds cute whether as friends or as more	pos
no thats actually so adorable  i would love if anyone asked to get ice cream with me	pos
no  in fact youre totally based	neg
no honestly as a guy whos admittedly a little old fashioned i love simple dates like this  id be flattered and if he likes you he wont turn it down  hell if he really likes you he wouldnt turn down watching paint dry as long as he can talk to you in the meantime  i dont know a single guy who would turn down a date just because of the activity involved	pos
just because someone likes going to the club doesnt mean thats the only sort of thing theyd ever want to do  anyway its not exactly a particularly romantic place lmao  its also not lame to ask someone out and not take them somewhere insane  going to get food is pretty normal	pos
it might be a cute idea depending on the type of person he is  if he is like an emo stoner dont do it  and if he is judging by what youve said i doubt youll work out  just keep your expectations realistic	pos
no youre right about that that was stupid of me to add were above the legal drinking age but not for smoking or going to the club goes to show how little i know about that	neg
brother in like 90 of europe people smoke at a young age same with drinking	pos
do you because i dont	neg
right its ice cream	neg
i dont smoke  i drink occasionally  theres like at least 5060 kids out of the 250 in my school that smoke  almost everyone i know drinks occasionally in a night out  im talking about ages like 15	pos
im 16  everybody in my school is 15 very few people in my school drink or smoke	neg
which country do you live in	neg
switzerland you	neg
greece  honestly ive never heard anything about how kids are in switzerland but i know that in all of eastern europe uk germany italy is for sure not too different from here  i know smoking is really big in france too	pos
netherlands too most people either smoke or vape  and generally drink from the age of 15 some even 14	neg
yes ive always known that many people at school dislike me but the funniest part is when all my friends  except a few  decided to turn on me and my exbest friends tried to jump me at school for no reason at all  even though there was 2 of them i held my own and didnt get hurt   crazy world we live in fr	pos
all my mates at uni have said was that their first impressions of me was that i was a bit of a dick  still not sure why	neg
holy shit  howd you manage to make your way through med school	neg
i have been thinking about if i have higher functioning autism  do you know what some common symptoms are	neg
i didnt  still in med school now  life hit me hard asf in high school  graduated 530532 but crawled my cooked as out of it somehow  smh still hurts to this day but got to keep going you know	neg
i mean how did you manage to get to med school despite a shit highschool life	pos
then i wont use functioning labels then  i guess levels are a better way to describe someone with autism	pos
ah gotcha my bad  well  long story  but to make it short i went to community college and eventually a 4 year institute  worked my butt off to get insane grades  went to 3 colleges at the same time taking 36 credit hours in a single semester and maintained a 4  0 in a straight 132 credit hours   i did this because my community college grades were trash being less than a 2  0  so i started off pretty much the worse student in high school  rank 530532  and on my way to be a doc now  never let your grades make you think you cant be someone special  im living proof  not a soul cared about me  but dam it man it hurts sometimes  so many people had it so much easier  i had to prove myself at every  single  corner  while others got all the help they needed  teachers in high school tossed me out like garbage  to this day i dont understand why my teachers couldnt see my potential and i still break down and cry every now and then  but we got to keep pushing on king  and i god dam guarantee that any kid in hs struggling i know about will know that atleast this guys got their back because i know how it is to have no one rooting for me	neg
dont just respond to their texts but also initiate conversations yourself come up with questions and shit	neg
i prefer irl convos  everything flows a lot better	pos
after a certain age its just hard to hold conversations with people  i tried and gave up  now we just plan to hang  if youre not in the same city then just texting someone for no reason isnt gonna work except you want to rant or talk about something specific	neg
ask questions of me show interest in what im saying not every time but maybe half the time extending the conversation when it dies  the last one in particular shows initiative and that youre putting in effort where many wouldnt but they all do  im almost never more excited than when my girlfriend asks me how my day was and i have something fun to tell her	pos
lmao its been the other way around for me  im the only one initiating convos asking questions etc  tired of this shit	neg
are you talking to them or are you replying to them talking means you ask questions you want to learn about them  how their day went and all that  replying means you are just answering which might be very fun for you is exhausting on the other side  think about that	pos
lol okayy  duly noted	pos
sir yes sir	pos
mm i see  i think i could try doing that even though its kinda dangerous lol  pepper spray time d	neg
this is really awesome advice  thank you	pos
i feel like they send the first text which is great but then there are no attempts to keep the convo going  the first text is kinda lazy too  like instead of just saying im pretty they coulda commented on something im wearing or whatever  hope you find someone that actually puts thought into texting you	pos
im the one thats asking questions about their day hobbies etc they literally just answer my question and then thats it  i lowkey am about to give up	neg
indeed  also find something that your both interested in or like and talk about that  do you like history oh whats your favourite history fact stuff like that	pos
i usually dont hang out except i got your contacts irl or a friend knows you	pos
then dont entertain them its a point of life  just let em be	neg
we had to do a presentation in english class for a short story about gang violence  me and my partner brought nerf guns and pretended to shoot each other as the introduction to our presentation  thankfully the teacher thought it was hilarious	neg
i remember back when i was 10 or 11 my school had a disciplinary teacher  his job was literally to get mad and punish students  hed always carry a long ass ruler to intimidate students  i never really got in trouble much but whenever i saw him id just say hi and ask him how his day was as opposed to the normal reaction  side eye and shuffle away   one day he caught me doing something i shouldnt and he basically told me to stop while waving the ruler around and i said something along the lines of the more you wave that around the more im tempted to watch you break it trying to get me and for some reason that just tickled him pink	neg
literally the school chaplain was teaching and some dude said something obvious feeling smart  i responded with yeah no shit sherlock he laughed for like 5 seconds but then called me off for my language	pos
what is black note fever	neg
black note fever is a term used to describe the feel  read dread  when musicians encounter music written predominantly in sharp or flat keys  these keys have a higher number of black keys on the piano keyboard hence the term black note fever	neg
must be a music thing  black notes can be found on music sheets  that might be the reference	neg
here they dont care so long as the math is done	neg
im aware but where does the fever come in	neg
id imagine fever refers to feel good or playful when she creates or listens to music  thats why she doesnt write in black cause im guessing shes a colourful person  but i might be completely wrong	neg
the more you know  thanks for clarifying	pos

It's a fucking war memorial, not a photo op."	neg

Edit: Wow. Wasn't expecting the comment to be that good. Thank you for the award kind stranger! My first one."	pos

"Oh man, this reminds me of every Teamlab installation I've gone to.  


Crowds and crowds of people lining up to take pictures against a wall with a flowery projection on it. The funniest part is seeing two to three girls giggling and laughing, one goes over, crouches, looks super sad and away from the camera, then immediately back to giggling and squealing after the photo is taken."	pos
I cant even figure out what the hell she is doing. Like no matter how you try to frame it this looks bizarre.	neg
"I actually got secondhand embarrassment from that, cringe as hell"	neg
Holy shit I retracted into myself with cringe	neg
This whole thing of targeting and mocking people who are just living their life in a way that doesn't affect you at all is so bizarre to me. You wouldn't post this kind of thing if you didn't feel hurt by this girl...looking...around...an aquarium??? This says a lot more about the losers trying to bring people down that is does about the people making money from going out and doing things.	neg
Christ thats so cringeworthy. Orange shirt dad taking the piss is awesome though	pos
"Funny, the dad was better, at least he was funny"	pos
"This is so cringey. It ruins the aquarium experience for others when people do shit like this. The orange shirt guy, though...gold star content."	neg
This is no different than the clip of Elizabeth Olsen using her superpowers without the special effects. It looks stupid in person but will look good after editing	pos

Mockery is considered rude, but it is also how humans are socialized to keep others ""in line,"" and in instance, I think mocking the expectation (not the victims of said expectation, mind you) will go a long ways toward fighting it. Its a lot more effective to meet ""wow shes really aged"" with ""Shes fucking 50, Gene, you've aged in 30 years too. Thats how a lifespan works.""

Usually when you are invited to get free food its not just you and a date.

Some people take photos with iPhones but Ive seen girls with $8000 photography rigs at these events. The restaurant and bar has a gentlemans agreement they can use any of these photos on social media, making it a great way to get a years worth of posts for free.

"> NO ONE has ever accepted to come under this condition.

Ofcourse! for that to happen, influencers would need to do their job ""for the society"" in the first place but that's not what influencers are, they simply do what they do solely for their own benefit.

I often like to compare them to estate agents because estate agents is the type of job that I hated to oblivion before influencers surfaced. You'd think they not just do the job for themself but for landlords and renters but nope, not a chance, for that to happen you would really need to work. By work when talking about estate agents I mean you gotta learn the measurements in the rooms, any slight things that's extraordinary about the house/flat/apartment you're trying to sell, nearby infrastructure if you're good at the job and a lot more stuff that people fond in that field could list but I cannot since I'm not working in that field. But in reality, easily about 85+% estate agents don't even know how big the rooms are that they're showing. This is why there have been countless of scandals, estate agents calling in people for a lookaround in the property and when people ask things about the property you can see the agents go ""Give me a second, I'll ask the landlord"".

There certainly are people active in both fields that deserve to work in those fields but it's like the app store and google play store, to every one good entry there are thousand bad ones because there's no quality check in place and just about every idiot can ""call themself"" an estate agent or influencer just like everybody with half a brain and too much time on their hands can put up a simple app on the stores."	pos

"I absolutely hate people who do this. I started blogging in 2010 and it was for fun and was basically my online journal of fashion. And it picked up. By 2014, I won best fashion blogger in my country, that was judged by a panel of various authors and people in different creative fields. During the course of those years, I came face to face with so many entitled bloggers and influencers who thought they deserved free stuff in exchange for a post. Meanwhile, I used to share what I liked regardless of whether I was getting paid to do so. Ive dined with a bunch of acquaintances who work in PR, some who handle hotels and they have such horror stories. They regularly get emails asking for free stays and free spa days and what not. 

During my blogging career, I was invited to a ton of places to test menus and have a dining experience. I only accepted if my sister or mom was willing to accompany me. Other cafes and restaurants would reach out and offer their venue as a shoot location and want a location tag as a deliverable. The shoot would have to happen before it was open to diners, so we would get the place while the staff was prepping. So it made sense to stay back and have a meal. Almost at every single place I stayed back for lunch, they always offered to take care of our bill and we always insisted on paying. A few times we came to a compromise and said okay the food is on the house, well pay for the drinks. 

Other times, Ive been invited to sample a Christmas menu or a specific menu and I usually would take a close blogger friend or my sister along. I remember the first time my friend and I went off-menu and decided to order an appetiser from the regular restaurant menu. Our order was taken but I noticed our waiter having a conversation with the manager who initially welcomed us. The manager shortly approached us with a mild worried look and very nicely tried to tell us that the appetiser we ordered wasnt part of the tasting menu. So we told him thats fine, well be paying for anything off menu and he appeared relieved, so I cant imagine how many other bloggers/influencers theyve dealt with, who refused to pay after eating."	pos

"I think I've been called influencer a few times. The name sucks and I want to punch people who think being an influencer is something to strive for. I'm posting this from my ""work"" account instead of my regular account because some people would recognize me.

Writing reviews for eateries, mom and pop stores, hang outs, taverns, events and attractions in my regional area is what I do for fun. I have a small following of about 11,000 people who live and work in this area which is about a 150-mile radius of where I live.

In the six years I've become ""famous"" regionally, I've never accepted one gift, not one free lunch, not even an extra cup of coffee. Any reviewer worth his salt would turn down any such such bribe, I mean gratuity. Such a gift would skew the review, jaundice the actual truth and makes the reviewer nothing but a lapdog.

There have been several times I've been asked to review a new restaurant for press purposes; asked by owners to review their tavern or bar, try their new beer or food dishes, attend grand openings of tax offices (not kidding) in exchange for a free meal or alcohol or my taxes done. I've turned all those requests down.

Im so glad theres so many skin positivity pages on Instagram now of young women (and men) sharing their stories of their struggle with acne and being open about it.

If they had iPhones, theyd be taking pics too. Are we not allowed to enjoy modern day conveniences  just because people 20+ years ago didnt have it? I hate this superiority everyone on reddit feels over people (usually women) taking pictures of themselves. You would think that that each snap sucks out your brain with how judgmental people are about taking pics at Coachella. Taking a couple pictures does not mean youre not living in the moment. It means you want to capture the moment you you have some physical reminders of the great time you had.

"I never really wore much make up because my skin was good, complexion was good, even tone. Just add moisturizer luckiness. Just tinted lip balm and eyeliner. On fancier days I'd use eyeshadow and blush. My husband thought that was great and wonderful, never really said anything except how beautiful I looked.

As life went on, I developed allergies and had a hard time finding, and affording, those few makeup items that didn't break me out. 

And then my skin started to change with age issues... So I bought a hypoallergenic tinted moisturizer. 

My husband screamed at me about what a whore I was and how I must be cheating on him. It was intense. I never finished that bottle of moisturizer because the screaming was so intense every time I used it. (And then he guilted me for buying this expensive stuff and not using it)

After we divorced, he saw a picture of me with a full face of make up on (I'd been able to purchase things that didn't break me out after divorcing) at a friend's birthday party. He wasn't blocked, at that point, and he went on a full fledged rampage calling me a bar whore, slut, and every other thing imaginable. 14 screen shots worth of abuse. 

These days, if I'm meeting up with people for fun I put on my go to face of moisturizer (tinted if needed), tinted lip balm and some level of eye make up. I'll go full face for parties or events. Otherwise, I'm just entertaining myself, so I'm good with my bare face! 

And apparently I needed to word vomit my story... If you read this far... Thanks! Lol"	pos
"Hai guys it's my pict hahaha omg thankyou so much for your positive response,hello, my name is iwie and i like to do makeup character you can check my artwork at my instagram @rockmansick 
i make this meme just for fun and this meme inspiration from cartoon hate her so i recreated the meme in real makeup. I can't belive this meme so viral, So many negative response i got from people's who don't understand the point.

"Omg, we were shooting a series of educational videos for my moms business in LA with a $60k budget and the producer hired a professional makeup artist and she did my moms makeup just like the top left."	pos
"I did my makeup for about 25 minutes before work where I was hired for looks.   I was wearing a TON of makeup but I chose natural colors.   I was sent on a break by my female pitboss to ""put on some makeup"" and she claimed I was wearing none.   

I had on foundation,  bronzer,  blush,  eyeliner,  brows,  two different eye-shadows, and mascara.   

I went to the back and smothered my eyes in black eye-shadow that looked horrible and went back.   She was like thanks! 

Smh if she ever saw me without makeup she would probably die! "	neg
"Ive always been told by people around me that because Im a girl I have to wear makeup even though I look pretty without it. 

My mom told me to do whatever I want because makeup is uncomfortable.

I tried makeup when I was about 14-15. Hated it. And I havent worn any since. I dont even wear mascara because it makes my eyelashes too long and they hit my glasses whenever I blink. 

Its just uncomfortable. "	neg
She looks like her own mom wtf	neg
"People who see my without my makeup for the first time usually think I'm sick or about to faint any moment, I have eye bags/dark circles under my eyes for a few years now and it takes a lot to cover them. Now combine that with ""hollow"" cheeks even though I'm not overall thin and you get a zombie-like face with no makeup!

It's so accurate. I couldn't count how many times I've applied foundation, mascara and mixed up 3 different shades/colors of eyeshadow and my friends were like ""oh, but you barely have any makeup on!"". Sure, girls, I was born with silver and light pink tones on my lids!

When going out I usually wear something similar to the actual heavy makeup shown here, experimenting with various eyeliners and shadows, depending on the occassion. It does take a while to do it properly, blend the colors and make sure the liner is drawn with no visible mistakes. I can't imagine how much time I'd need to get an effect in the first part of the picture, the only time I've had eyeliner that long was when my friend was drawing it for me and... hell, why am I even thinking about it, I don't really want to look like a clown!

No amount of makeup will hide my zombie cheeks tho. Not gonna happen."	neg

Anyway, having the screen that big, and especially sitting close, my kid always reserves 3rd row, REALLLLY shows the skin of the actors!! We saw Godzilla vs Kong last night and the lead actress, Rebecca Hall, had pores and fine lines! One guy had a ton of acne. He had dark skin so it wasn't red but verrry bumpy. No shade, I'd never want my face up there, it was just a nice change.  Millie Bobby Brown even had imperfections. The all looked like real people!

"To be fair, that doesn't mean you can't strive for it and get somewhere along the way. Sure none of us can afford a trainer, a nutritionist, and on top of that have the will power to resist all junk food. 

But there are plenty of resources online to learn about proper weight lifting and nutrition. Make it s lifestyle to go to the gym every day for 1 to 1.5 hrs, plus an extra 30 minutes for the 3 mile runs. Do not buy unhealthy foods to take home and learn to cook. Sure the workplace food will always be a struggle, but don't put obstacles on the way. NO ONE has the willpower to resist a pack of almighty Oreos, so just don't buy them.

This is what I follow. I don't look quite like the guy on the pic, but I'm very happy with where I'm at. It doesn't have to be an all or nothing. Trying will go a long way. That's just my 2 cents."	pos
"I have to disagree, a lot of bodybuilders who have reached world class status started with shoe string budget while working other jobs, for all the supplement endorsement and riches.
Many people strive to achieve a good physique by putting the effort day in and day out. Sure it is difficult, but it's way better than the alternative of having been fed like an animal for slaughter.
I invite anyone to challenge me that, 'abs is unrealistic'
Eat your veggies, eat your protein, be active at least 4 times a week and don't over eat. That's all is required to be in decent shape.
Celebrity posts like this are discouraging and portray the wrong message that ideal male physique is impossible to achieve unless you're rich, because it is not only easy but sustainable, it just requires a person to be mature about their food choices."	pos
"This is on post I don't agree with at all. These steps aren't *needed* to achieve that body. Maybe to reach to body in the short amount of time he did but simple follow a strength training routine (SS, 5/3/1), 3 ~5 days a week, learn about nutrition and eat right. 

You can achieve this body in a year or 2 of hard work. But that's what it takes hard work and effort and most people aren't willing to put that work in. 


Ive been lifting on and off for 7 years and have a body like make but less lean and more muscle mass. I've been going gym 3 days a week, sometimes I get 6 hours sleep, don't spend stupid amounts of money, never had a trainer, taught myself, read books, resources online, sometimes I great at midnight (it's also been proven by trainers it doesn't matter what time you eat, simply calories in and calories out at the most important part of dieting).


This is more a post by someone who knows Jack shit about dieting, weightlifting and getting jacked.

Yeah it's hard with a normal 9-5 job and busy life but it's doable for normal people just takes focus and discipline."	pos

Just a question, I've been told by a lot of people that most of these abs in pics we see are flexed, is this true?"	pos
"Most of this they teach you when you're on stage. That being said, its refreshing seeing guys like him that dont use photoshop, worked damm hard for thier bodies and just flex the right way to get that perfect aesthetic."	pos
Wow I feel so dumb. TIL that men with muscles only have muscles when they flex.	pos

"Oh God not her. Ok guys this is gunna be a long comment. She so obviously wore colored contacts before the surgery, it AMAZES me how no photographers, photo editors, managers, touchups, etc. did not see this. 

[You dont even need to zoom in this close to see it is so damn obvious they were contacts and circle lenses. Unless your *one blue eye* suddenly changes patterns and turns turquoise to royal blue within a few days, I dont know how anyone was fooled by this.](https://i.imgur.com/06IdfSS.jpg)

True heterochromia has specks of color, it's not just a *solid bold border* between each of the eye colors without any diffusion. You can literally SEE her real brown eye under the blue contact. Also, I have one of those blue circles lenses in real life lol. 

She did all of this for solely attention, [including breast augmentation that looks equally as bad. People always comment on how solid her breasts looks](https://i.imgur.com/DCxsajs.jpg)

But she bothers me for another major reason which is that she is an overall awful, horrible trash person who uses people for her own gain and is majorly homophobic. This is all coming from her own father who is on IG. Her father is openly bisexual and he's said that she's bullied and abused him relentlessly for it, as well as taken advantage of his kindness for her ""modeling"" career amongst other things. Here's a bunch of his IG comments [1](https://i.imgur.com/teTpoNC.jpg) [2](https://i.imgur.com/YtWlFCs.jpg) [3](https://i.imgur.com/Bww0RWX.jpg)

Also one of her previous social media handles was blatantly just the word f*ggot but with an additional letter to make it sound quirky. 

There are way more comments from her dad but this is just a snippet of what I found online from a different forum. I know this is messed up but I've been following along with her because I'm just wondering when her eye will go blind and if she will finally give up her ruse, or claim it was cause by her ""genetic heterochromia"". 

To anyone curious about the eye surgery, it is called Bright Ocular and it is *highly illegal*. It is not approved by any FDA and any opthalmologist who suggests or approves getting it done is only in it for your money. This is why people go to India and Columbia to do this shady operation. There are some horribly awful and sad videos of BO patients having the implants removed only to have [permanent eye damage](https://youtu.be/IYahjF6QX-s) or [complete blindness (slight NSFW?)](https://youtu.be/x53DnZC1JKE).

Also here's an example of her taking a famous models picture and posting it as her own. [Original](https://i.imgur.com/YOMBT3w.jpg) vs her [stolen edited version ](https://i.imgur.com/BIdM1nw.jpg)

"Shit like this is the reason I used to get so stressed over my skin when I was younger because my foundation always looked rubbish and very obvious. These influencers had me thinking my overly expensive Chanel foundation would magically smooth and airbrush away any texture and make me have perfect skin, when in reality they were having the same cakey nightmare as me. 

Ive had to slowly learn that no one really looks good in natural light with half a ton of makeup on their faces, you look like a clown, as evidenced above. 

At what point do we just call this false advertising.

Edit: can I just say, no, I was not putting it on wrong, I wasnt using the wrong products, and my skin was still young and fresh. Im an old lady and this started well over 10 years ago when Elle and Blair were the queens of youtube and girls plastered dream Matt mouse all over their faces. I bought so much makeup over the years in an effort to recreate this kind of look, low and high end, and honestly had far too much for one person. I had the sponges, the brushes, the primers, I bought into to all. Nothing ever gave me the result I wanted because faces have pores and hairs and just texture and I dread to think how much of my student loan went to Mac etc. in an effort to achieve it. 

Youre never really going to get a full coverage foundation to look like your skin, its always going to look like foundation. Its great for photos and dark night clubs, not so suitable for a day at the office under fluorescent lights. The only positive is _some_ influences understand this and do closeups of what their faces actually look like during reviews now."	pos

This is image compression from using different lenses. Its not an intentional attempt to look skinny one place and not in another. It probably was just a choice made by the photographer based on whatever factors they had to deal with on the day of the shoot.	neg

Why put up a couple packs of uncooked bacon in the photo too lol?	pos
I mean.. this took a while. Why not just cook the damn thing?	neg

"I know a girl in a similar position to her. Her housemate fell asleep cooking chips after a night out, started a house fire, panicked and ran out without thinking to wake her up. When the fire brigade found her, they thought she was dead. She was severely burned over nearly all of her body. Lost all her hair, lost her voice and the abilities to walk for a long time (not sure if that was due to the flesh damage, or the muscle). It was absolutely horrific.

I can't express how much I want to hug the Instagram lady there. So glad she made it."	neg
I can't even imagine how much that would have hurt	neg
"Ive gotten little burns on my fingers from cooking that have blistered up, cant imagine having burns (looks to be 3rd degree from the amount of scar tissue) to this extent. I hope she is doing well."	pos

"I know the intention was good, but all this does is fuel my hyper-self-conscious anxiety spiral where I become convinced that I look absolutely terrible in real life. 

Like for anyone who wears makeup: that sensation when you look in the mirror in a place with fluorescent lighting and realize that the light you did your makeup in was *way* too warm and you look like a clown. This tiktok is like that feeling getting injected it straight in the veins."	pos
"I remember my old boss, a guy, used to do TV shopping channel shows.  On TV, he'd look great and normal.

Then he'd come back to the office and hadn't had the chance to take his makeup off.  He looked like a drag queen clown who'd been crying because of the sweat from the lights.

Under the lights, it looks so much different. Don't trust what you see on TV.  In real life, people look very different."	neg
"It doesnt make any sense that there would be collateral from a warping tool that far away from her, and only on one side of the dogs face. Ive noticed a lot of the warp fail tagged posts on here are just people using the wide angle lens on newer smartphones. barrel distortion from wide angle lenses creates this effect. I see it in the lamp shade and towards the bottom of the frame."	neg
Is she being honest or is this some backhanded brag about the thirsty messages she gets and how money she spent on herself?	pos
"I mean, no tea no shade to the girl but that person must be blind to oil at her and think yep. All natural beauty. Its prob just one of those creepy dudes on insta that all they do is comment random compliments on any post girls make no matter what the content is."	pos

"Not defending the videos at all but I think the point has been lost in translation.

These are extremely exaggerated and is more so a viral trend. Not talking about the filters but the makeup; its more so for comedic contrast. In the after videos there are some giveaways such as different hair or outfit differences. They probably to their makeup normally and less clownish when they film it with the filters."	pos
When your buddy offers to cook but they start by putting raw chicken in the microwave	pos
Ignoring the face slimming edits for a moment... WHY the pink toned under eye concealer? The contrast between the bronzy warm foundation and fleshy pink under eyes just increases the alien vibes. Such a weird make up flop.	neg

Some people have eyes this colour though. I knew a Polish girl who had like the slightest hint of the palest shade of baby blue.	pos
"I mean.... angles plus good lighting do make a huge difference. 

Its like when you go to take a picture but the camera is facing the wrong way. I usually end up looking like a nasty troll when I see my face instead of what I want to take a picture of. But when I got to take a picture of myself, with the same phone, and I hit my angles right at golden hour then I look damn good with fckin princess vibes."	neg

Some older people are soooo damn obsessed with looking younger its so cringy.	neg

I'll accept that I'm a chad thank you.	pos
"My nose always looks soooooo crooked in selfies. In mirrors, there is a slight tilt but in selfies or videos, it looks like my nose is about to yeet off my face. Ive brought up my crooked nose insecurity to some friends once and how I want to get a nose job. They assured me that I dont have a crooked nose. 

I wish it was easier to take selfies. I like the face zoom filter on Tiktok but you cant take a picture with it."	pos

"Hoodies hide the reality quite frequently. But damn he should have picked a better outfit cause that collar under that long sleeve is just stating it doesn't fit him right. If you can't button it all the way up to your neck it's not the right size, which he should have done cause it ruins the low key professional look he's trying for also the long sleeves neckline is the wrong shape for this look..."	neg

This just gives me Russian nesting doll vibes. Like the second photo is a babushka hidden inside the instagram version.	pos
Second photo: the dress is still in alterations and she is not wearing any makeup... just stating facts 	neg
I don't know. I guess this is cool but it also seems like she's kind of low key throwing shade at other girls. Just post whatever you want and stop worrying about what other people do. IMO.	neg
Only thing she's positive about is that Gucci bag	pos

"I find this to be so incredibly strange. Why are people like this? I live in an ordinary apartment with sticky fly traps hanging from the ceiling in a couple rooms and I really don't care if I accidentally get one of those ugly things in my picture I guess I just dont understand the point or value of ""likes"" on a post. In most circumstances your life is going to remain the same life it has always been regardless of how many likes you get. Maybe I'm turning into a boomer."	pos
Thanks for letting me know that Ive been sleeping on Kendrick Lamar and need to listen to more rap :) 	pos

Do the people do their lip color like truly not realize they look like clowns?  Or like little kids playing with mommy's makeup?	pos
This is gonna sound thirsty but I think she looks great with makeup and filters	pos
"This has been going on for a while now. Lately people have started to notice that in every picture her eye has a different color of blue, and often there are brown spots or marks where the blue stops, and the pupil of that eye is even a lot smaller in some pictures compared to the other eye, indicating that she's either wearing a colored contact or has an app to change her eyecolor. The first one seems more legit, as she's done interviews and people have seen her in real life with the blue eye. She talks about being bullied and about taking a long time to accept that she has this disease. At that point even her own father called her out by posting a picture of her as a child with very dark brown eyes, saying that she does not have heterochromia at all. 

You see, I kind of understand the reason. I'm not saying that what she's doing is good, because faking a disease (or however this is called) is never okay, but these days it's so hard to become a model. A pretty face only is not enough. They need you to have something special. Like being an albino, or having vitiligo, and in this case heterochromia. Because it makes her stand out more from the crowd it's giving her way more opportunities. 

The latest thing that I have heard (and which was confirmed to be true according to the sources) is that she got an iris implant in her eye to change it from brown to blue, so that she doesn't have to struggle with the contacts anymore and so that it looks a lot more real. This procedure is only done in India and it's a very dangerous surgery that could lead to blindness in the eye(s) the procedure is done to. In shows like botched up bodies you can see a few cases of this, and it's truly terrible. In my opinion going to these lengths to fake something is insane and I think she should just come clean. No one believes her at this point anyway. Yes, she will get some shit for it, might lose her career. But I think going blind is much worse. And so is lying. She's beautiful nonetheless and I'm pretty sure she would have gotten a modeling career just by being ""normal"". Now she's getting hate. And I'm not a hater, nor am I a person that would recommend people to start hating but I do understand why she gets this hate."	neg

"By now if anyone is still looking at these women and thinking there is one thing on them that's natural I honestly don't know what to say. 

The fact she railed so hard against that photo then was like LOOK I AM SO HOT I SWEAR. Literally no one on God's green earth (who is a human being you'd be interested in paying attention to) looked at that photo and went 'oh no that's terrible'. She looks fucking amazing. And then to follow it up by putting up doctored 'real' images is just absolutely mind boggling. 

They are so strict about enforcing the sponsorship and ad rules on social media but there's no requirement to let the world know you are lying about how you look. It's not enhancing or touching up it is literally NOT their real faces or bodies. But sure, I'm super bothered that they don 't hastag soon on their shit yourself tea ads. Which is also rage inducing - they advertise that bullshit without having to disclose that their bodies are down to photoshop and surgery. Not laxatives."	neg
I was walking along a local river walk with my kid when I saw a girl all instad out sitting on the side of the walk on the ground with a tripod for her phone taking sultry pics for her account. It was cringy.	neg

I follow some Instagram models who post heres my stretch marks for the haters in *every single* post, along with multiple paragraphs that come across as pandering for YASS Girl comments and shares. 

I dont think Ive even seen anyone comment negatively on stretch marks, let alone enough to quantify as a large group representing public opinion. Sure you have your bitter incel trolls, but their opinions shouldnt even register with anyone, let alone matter to them."	pos

"Properly wash the rice you dingus! Post cleaning, the water should be almost transparent. Also just use a fucking saucepan instead of buying another single use gadget.

Cooking rice in saucepan instructions:

1. Clean rice until almost transparent
2. Add 1 cup of water per cup of rice + an extra half cup. Or use the finger trick - make rice and water level, stick index finger in just enough to touch the top of the rice. The water level should come up to the first/top knuckle.
3. Cover saucepan with lid and let sit for 10 mins
4. Turn on heat to full and bring water to boil.
5. Once at full boil let it boil for 1.5-2 mins.
6. As soon as top start looking not quite dry but not flooded with water (about 2 mins of full boil from step 5), bring heat to low and forget about it for 15 mins.
7. After 15 mins, turn off heat, remove lid, and fluff with fork. (If after 15 mins the rice is still wet or not completely cooked, go 20 mins next time around.)
8. Done. See not that difficult!"	pos

"I know Im old school and I have spent (4) decades of watching the general society implode on itself. 

Its both Hilarious and Messed up at the same time. 

At this point, its best to put yourself first and make sure your values and beliefs align with what makes sense for you as individual. (The other individuals in your life). 

(No shade to the Good Women). But some are more outta pocket than them trying to get you to empty yours. 

Sex and good Looks arent even the table they seem think they bring. 

Its more like the screws that hold up the legs up at best. (Other words, they Fucking Bugging and they know it too).

And most Men (like myself) will and have curved women like this IRL. (Unfortunately its been increasingly common this time around). 

So when a women who has an OF account or are consistently doing thirst traps on social media. 

How the Fuck can they complain?

You how fucking awkward it would be, to go out and see one of her Subs run up on her like, Great Fucking Show last night. Keep up the good work

Thats mainly just entertainment, and nothing more. (The individuals who actually pay to lay). 

And the (%) of women who are this stupid to follow such a Trend are the same ones who have the nerve in audacity, to ask why men wont hit on them. 

Some of these women are like - Find the person with the most money and try to take it By any means necessary. 

Clearly those poor souls missed the mark on just being a social IRL. 

Plus, with whats happening now, has happened over and over and over again. 

Its clearly a vicious social cycle. (That yes it will repeat itself in a different capacity both an annoyance in general social concern). 

But the last (2) decades, I chose me and have been cool ever since. 

If there is a person from whom your willingness to invest time and effort into and they try to devalue your efforts. 

Its time to dip out and keep your priorities and Peace as the main concern when dating or Fucking someone for sport. (Just use common sense and be safe as you can). 

Chivalry is dead , and Women killed it, and they were smiling while doing too. 

Joke is on them tho. 

Men can live in this world without having to deal with anyone. Especially if that person is only going to try and make something as simple as general interaction seem like your getting a root canal. 

Stay away from people like this, they are literally the purest representation of a real life social parasite."	pos

The door is now open. Locks will sometimes have a second mini bolt next to the first but interior doors usually do not, which is why this works (that second piece exists to stop this kind of picking). 

If you've ever watched a show or movie and they pick a lock using a credit card, this is how that works (although they often pick locks that this wouldn't work with).

Japanese work culture has its own problems but it seems like Nintendo is better at this than many others.  Teams have loyalty to company and churn out better games because of it.

Reminds me how the novelization for Star Wars episode III came out way before the movie. Spoiled the entire thing but also, is legit way better. Not just in the books are better way.

"The last time I was at a Waffle House two of the employees took off their shirts so that they could throw down with a disgruntled customer. They did this because the manager (who I found out afterwards that it was his first day on the job and his first day at this location) told them that they'd be fired for fighting in uniform.

One dude just kept right on trying to make everyone's food for the next like ten minutes, eventually got someone else's order and ate it."	neg
"So here's the thing with Waffle House that a lot of outside folks don't get. It's not just a restaurant. 

Is it a place you can go 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and get something to eat? Yes. Is it a dining establishment that's so reliable in terms of it's operating schedule that FEMA officials came up with the [The Waffle House Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_House_Index) to assess how devastated an area was after a natural disaster? Yes. 

But that's not all Waffle House is.

Waffle House is a place you'll go to with your parents for the first time. It's greasy disgusting breakfast food, but you're a *kid*. You love that shit. So maybe you end up going one day after church. Maybe you end up going while you're out visiting grandma and grandpa because Grandpa loves the place. You know *why* he loves the place? Because he went to that exact same Waffle House when it first opened. Hell, he took your dad to that Waffle House was he was your age. 

Now you're not a child anymore. You're a teenager. Maybe you just spent all night getting high as a fucking kite and you've got the munchies like you wouldn't believe. It's 3:30 in the morning, and you know what's open? That same Waffle House. And the folks at Waffle House have seen so much shit that they couldn't be assed to give a damn about some 16 year old with blood shot eyes who zones out staring at cup coffee for 5 minute straight. Maybe you just drove your shitbox corolla halfway across town in the middle of the night because your girlfriend texted you saying that she's sneaking out of the house, so you shut your headlights off and park a few houses down so her folks don't wake up and see her getting in the car. Where do you go at that hour? Waffle House. 


Now you're almost a man. It's your senior year of high school and you just broke up with that girl. You're not taking it well, so you raid dad's liquor cabinet to make the pain go away after him and your mother turn in for the night. It doesn't help, and now you're hungry. So you stumble into that same terrible 4 cylinder Japanese go-kart and head to the only restaurant that's open at that hour. Waffle House. You sit there downing an ungodly amount of coffee, grits, and hashbrowns while you sober up. As you sober up, you realize that what you just did was stupid. You could have gotten arrested if this town had more cops. You could have gotten hurt if you were a little more fucked up. And all over a girl. She wasn't worth it. But thankfully, the staff at Waffle House doesn't judge. They don't give a shit that you double parked, are obviously under 21, and reek of vodka. You're safe. You're free to wait there until the sun comes up and your vision stops being blurry. 

Now you're in your early 20's. You just went bar hopping with some buddies and met a new girl. Last call was 2am, but y'all don't want to part ways just yet. Maybe you're having too good of a time. Maybe the girls want to spend some more time with you so they can figure you out before the fun starts. So you all pile into your cars and head to the only place that's open. Waffle House. You're having a great time, and more importantly this chick you just met seems to be enjoying it to. You remember your dad mentioning that he used to do this shit with his friends when he was a young man. He even took your mom here when they first started dating. Hell, you and this chick might even end up sitting in the same booth they did. 

Waffle House isn't just a restaurant. It's not just a place where you can go at all hours of the night, under the influence of whatever and dressed however. It's a constant. Life changes, but Waffle House endures. It's an island of consistency in the ocean of uncertainty that is life. No matter which one you go to, no matter when you to it, you'll always get the same food, you're always there for the same reasons, and you'll always see the same kind of characters. It's not a place that you *go* to, it's a place that you *end up at.* But the circumstances that led to you ending up at Waffle House will stay with you in the back of your mind your entire life. 

Waffle House isn't just a restaurant, it's a God damn Southern institution. Fanning is a Georgia girl, so she gets it.

"article:

Marcus Lehto is the co-creator of the Halo games and, until 2012, was a senior creative on every Halo game made by Bungie. After that he left to set up on his own with the studio V1 Interactive (which made the shooter Disintegration), before joining EA in 2021 and founding Ridgeline Games, a Seattle-based developer that was working on a new Battlefield game with more of a story focus.

I say ""was"" because unfortunately Ridgeline has become one of the latest victims in a brutal period of game and tech layoffs. At the end of February EA announced that it would be closing the studio, and laying off all of its staff. Around the same time, Lehto announced he would be leaving the publisher. And he's not a happy camper.

""Gut punched to see EA lay off my team,"" said Lehto on X. ""So many very talented devs who were incredibly valuable to the Battlefield franchise.""

Lehto wants to make one thing clear: ""Yes, I left EA on my own accord. This was a very tough decision for me to make."" He thanks the Battlefield community, and wishes the remaining teams at EA all the best for the future, then turns his guns on the publisher.

""Not been saying much here since I dont have anything positive to say about EA [and] my recent departure,"" says Lehto. ""And how so many, including my team, are suffering due to the industry sweeping layoffs."" Lehto later posted on LinkedIn saying he's ""incredibly upset and very sad"" about the layoffs and Ridgeline ""are very talented people whose lives are being upended needlessly.""

The single-player campaign in the works at Ridgeline was a co-development with DICE, which Lehto had previously said would ""engage players in new ways."" It was apparently a standalone project, though what if anything will happen to it now is unknown. 

Lehto's enough of an industry veteran not to say what he really thinks: but you can certainly tell what he really thinks, and clearly this one cuts deep. Lehto ended his post by announcing he's going to take a break from the industry, and think about whether he even wants to return. ""In the meantime, I will be taking time away from games to see what, if anything, I want to do next."	pos

I was around 12 then and my older sister randomly came to me and said that if I was able to save up half of the total cost for one, she'd cover the other half and get it for me. She was in college around then and money obviously got tight so she couldn't afford it and I understood but somehow my dad found out about our agreement and just bought it for me anyway which was really unexpected (my parents were mostly typical Asian parents). I think she felt bad about that though cause a few years later, she bought me a DS when I jokingly asked for one for Christmas."	neg
"I will forever battle with myself between Bioshock and Infinite for which opening I prefer. I think both are excellent (and I went into both blind so being launched upwards instead of down was a big shock to me) but I feel that the Infinite opening runs all the way up until the aftermath of your first encounter with Songbird while the original feels a lot more concise and well-presented in a shorter span of time.


Infinite is like a great storybook leading you through a big prologue before you actually meet your main character, the original is like this awesomely disarming slap in the face before it shoves you through a cosmetic surgery theatre and into the broken dystopia with a wrench in your hand and a sudden fear of small children."	pos

You can just scroll through this subreddit and see that the online generations primary ideologies are anti-Americanism and cynicism.

Imo, the biggest blunder our parents made was not educating us properly themselves. They wouldn't talk to us directly, telling us to ask the school, our friends, or the internet. Education varies so much from place to place that parents need to understand what is being taught. Parents also need to fill in the gaps that the school won't teach. And the internet needs to be kept as far away from kids as humanly possible. Parents need to be more involved in their kids' lives. It's going to be uncomfortable and awkward, but parents are the ones with the most control here. Sit your kids down, and talk to them. Answer their questions as best as you can, no matter what they are. Tell them the truth about the internet, porn, nicotine, etc. And don't just scold and yell at them because that's only going to make them want to do it more. Fucking talk to them"	pos
"So life expectancy in 1960 was 71 years old. Today life expectancy is 78 years old.

We went through over 80 years of progrerss, massive cultural and social changes, thousands of new labs and research universities built around the world, trillions spent, and only got a couple extra years of life. And the crazy thing is that half of the population in 1960 smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol casually.

So what we need to do is continue discouraging smoking, continue to develop medicine, and turn culture and lifestyle back to exactly the way life was lived in 1960 specifically.

This should increase lifespan about 10 years at least."	neg

"this never happened to me personally, but my dad drove for Torontos subways and streetcars for 30 years. the amount of suicides hes seen is astonishing. just last month a mother and her newborn jumped. both passed away. my dad has always had therapy once a week my entire life, i understand why."	neg
"It wasn't me. It was my dad a few years before I was born.

He was a truck driver, and one late night while he was doing his normal drive between Sydney and Brisbane, a car coming in the opposite direction failed to make a turn.

The driver was close to his destination, and had likely decided to continue driving despite being tired. My dad had nearly 80 tonne worth of truck going 100km/h. He couldn't do anything. The car went under the front of his truck. The driver and his passenger were killed immediately. The passengers 3 children in the back were pinned, but alive. And awake. And screaming.

Being the early 90s, my dad had to run for the nearest house to get help. When he reached a farmhouse, he got them to call emergency. He couldn't bring himself to return to the scene of the accident, the screaming was already haunting him.

From that point on, my dad couldn't handle the sound of children crying. It broke my family. The actions of one idiot who didn't take a fucking nap.

My dad still had to drive that route several times a week. I remember watching him grip the steering wheel so tight every time he approached that corner.

Don't drive tired."	neg
"The hospital I was doing renovations at hired an engineer to calculate how many years it would take for the steam lines to cool down enough for them to demo. They didnt like the answer they got so they lied about the numbers to another engineer who gave them a better calculation. 

During the renovation, the demo company went out of business, so the general contractor asked us to demo the old steam line. Things were great for around 2 hours until the deeply buried steam pushed enough of the water head up enough that it could start making decent progress to the surface, we reported that something was wrong, but the hospital maintenance team essentially told us to go fuck ourselves, and eventually 1.5 hours later the water started working its way out. 

We were hauling hundred gallon barrels of water out of the building two at a time, while the water kept coming out faster and hotter. By the time we were able to get a cap that could fit around the pipe, high pressure steam was coming out strong enough that it wasnt visible for a good 1.75 from the pipe. In laymans terms it was hot enough to instantly strip the flesh off your bone, and almost hot enough to instantly burn through your bones. There was no capping that pipe. 

So sure enough, thousands of gallons of very old oily and filthy steam flooded the hospital, dozens of people died due to infections and unsanitary conditions, mostly people who were too critical of condition to move. There was an attempt to sue us, then the engineer, but it was very quickly proven that everything was caused by gross negligence on the hospitals part, and was promptly swept under the rug. 

Its painful looking back on it with hind site, if I knew what I did now I would have kicked down the maintenance office door and beat the shit out of those two faced assholes before taking a cap that they had on hand a good 1.5 hours before it was too late to do anything, and dozens of people including children would still be alive. 

I know its not my fault, I know that I did everything I could have done with the knowledge I had at the time, and I saved a person from getting badly hurt or possibly killed, but there was so much time, and so many things that so many people did wrong, any one of them doing one thing better and the whole nightmare would have never happened."	neg

"My dad hates movies with subtitles. My mom is a foreign film buff. She has been trying to change him for DECADES. And while he'll sit through (and sometimes even enjoy) them on occasion, he'll still groan any time she suggests a movie with subtitles.

The ultimate disappointing non-dealbreaker.

**EDIT:** Ok, I'm just going to add this here before anyone else asks if my dad can read. He's an oncologist. He's not dumb. He can keep up with the subtitles and the subject matter. He just does so much reading for work (he goes through medical journals like crazy) he wants to relax with something silly and mindless, that requires zero effort on his part. He feels the same way about tearjerkers (another of my mom's favorites) where people die slowly from some awful disease. He gets enough of that shit at work. But he'll occasionally sit through them for my mom. We just watched the old Julia Roberts film, Dying Young (where she nurses/falls in love with a young guy dying of cancer) and for half the film he was just looking at my mom with an expression that clearly read ""why the fuck would you do this to me?"""	pos

"So anyway, I went outside and decided to do some yard work because its a beautiful spring day. Mid 40s, sunny. A perfect day to spend outside and enjoy this beautiful day we get to enjoy. 

And even knowing all of that it still wouldnt be the number one best thing to happen. And also probably laugh at his cult followers making weird AI images of him as an angel looking like Rambo and who replaces God in heaven since he fired him.

It will be a strange time, for sure."	pos
"Thats a tough question to answer, and I think to a certain extent its person specific.  For example, Ive struggled w cigarettes most of my life, but my wife doesnt.  Im clean now, but I know if I have even one, Ill be back up to a pack a day in no time.  On the other hand, my wife struggles w alcohol addiction whereas I went cold turkey from drinking a handle of whiskey a week without much issue.  

Just based on physiological response, probably alcohol or heroine as Ive heard cessation both can kill you if youre too dependent.  However, things like cigarettes/alcohol can be harder in a way because theyre more ubiquitous in society, advertised openly, and plenty of people use them without ruining their lives.  I hate to say it, but you can probably include many prescription pills in that category nowadays.  "	neg
"Not my story, but a buddy of mine who was a self-employed welder. He would do calls mostly to ranches, barns, and other rural and livestock type usually repairing gates, corrals, and equipment.

Anyhow, he showed up one day at a stable for 4H kids and was gonna fix some fencing for the paddock. The lady who ran the stables mentioned her husband was out of town picking up a horse they bought.

Long story short, she invited him inside to cool off. This is 102 degree Texas weather so anyone would naturally take the offer. She gave him a tall glass of tea, water, and some fruit to cool off while she went to change. 

Within a couple minutes she came down the stairs in just panties and asked if he wanted to take a nice cool shower. He told me it was REALLY hard to say no, but he declined only because he had been cheated on before and never wanted another man to feel that pain.

Edit: Since a couple people asked:

4H is a program across the U.S. that helps kids and teenagers with development skills in science, agriculture, community outreach, and various other programs. In this case the 4H club was agriculture. So they learn how to ride horses, care for them, feed them, brush them etc."	pos
"Only heard of it happening once. Worker was single and in really good shape. And the woman at the house was married with younger kids. Not sure how it happened but he fell in love with her and ruined her marriage. He went crazy chasing her and she went back to her husband. Word on the street is that her husband ending up leaving her a year later and got to keep the kids and she ended up paying child support and alimony to him after cheating. 

It was lose-lose all around. 

Oh and the business the husband and wife were running together went under and their handful of employees consequently lost their jobs too."	neg

I got to Barnes and noble and the mom was by herself and we start talking and she says what do I think about older woman and I said they are older. She asked if I wanted to go to her house which I declined. 
She called the school I work for saying I asked her on a date and I was making sexual advances.
Thankfully I had the texts saved where she asked me to meet her."	pos
"HVAC tech here, mostly residential. Ive def seen my fair share of voyeur housewives who will leave doors open when theyre changing. Only time I was ever propositioned was after I had done a repair.

"19 and worked on my families farm while in College, mostly irrigation, tractor work and sheering. One season the neighbouring farm asked if I would be interested in working for them for a day or two, jumped at the opportunity since the money was reallllly good and I enjoyed the physical workout (I just got in to rugby that year and the farm work helped me). 

My usual farm attire, jeans, blunnies, singlet and a long sleeve flanny. 

The next few days its supposed to be around 35 degrees. I rock up early in the morning, got my gear set up, met the father, his wife and his daughter Rebecca (daughter is 2 years older than me) I meet the rest of the crew and we smash it out. First day we get most of it done.

Day 2: I get there around 7am and it's around 19 degrees already. I briefly noticed the parents vehicles aren't in the garage as I make my way down to the sheering sheds.

It's almost lunchtime and I'm already hot as fuck, feels like 40. I got sweat happening, I pull of my flanny, wipe my face down and power through the last 10 heads. Done.

I take a small break and start carting my gear to my truck. As I'm passing the house with my last few things  I hear Rebecca call my name from the fly screen door, I make my way up and stand outside the screen, I'm blind as heck because I didn't even notice she was naked at the time. She opened the screen door and yanked me in real fast. I remember feeling really disrespectful for entering the house with my boots on lol that boat sailed though when she just straight up said ""fuck me"" while laying down on a towel she had placed. 1. Didn't think I had any energy leftover (I was wrong) 2. I like to be a little rough and 3. I'll never forget how nice and cold the tiles felt while we fucked. 

It wasn't my first time but I'll always remember that one. Pretty sure she has like 3 kids now last time I heard."	pos

"You probably mean illicit drugs, but there's a LOT of scary easily prescribed stuff out there.

I tried Champix (can't remember the American name for it) to quit smoking years ago. Originally it was a mental health drug of some sort, but they realised during drug trials that all the test subjects stopped smoking... So hey, big pharma doing profity type things... Quit smoking drug.

One of the side effects was ""vivid dreams"", sounds great, bring it on! After about 2 weeks I woke up in sweats because I thought I was being eaten by a giant spider. Ok, fine, that's awesome, how vivid was that?!? But 20ft spiders don't exist, so we're cool.

The next week I ordered a wash mit for my car. Yeah, boring. I had a dream it had been delivered and spent 8 god damn hours searching my 1 bed flat for this thing. I only stopped when the delivery actually happened and I realised I dreamt the first delivery. Jesus... But ok, I'm not smoking I guess.

A week later I ask one of my employees how a bit of work is coming along... Apparently I hadn't even asked him to do it, apparently I dreamt it. That could be him taking advantage though to be fair. :p

I stopped taking it at that point, I was seriously losing my mind. In America I think they nicknamed it the suicide drug... And I can see why. Can you imagine waking and thinking you've done something so horrible, so against who you are, you just can't live with it? It's the first time I've really been appreciative of not having guns in our bedside draws over here."	pos
"Datura. It's a fucking deliriant and highly poisonous so stay the hell away from it. I made the mistake of trusting an old friend who told me the trip would be mild and it really did start off pretty chill. I guess I took to much though. 

I got talking to this gal on the couch and we were really hitting it off so we started kissing after a bit. It turns out she was a snake in sheep's clothing. Well, a blanket to be exact. I was kissing a fucking blanket in front of the party. 

I've got the hunger that only betrayal and sadness can cause so I decided I needed  bowl of cereal. As I'm sitting on a stool and talking to what I hope was real people, I lose my balance and tip backwards. I ended up breaking through the window and partially dangling there, face covered in sugary milk, while some people are trying to pull me back into the house. 

Time has lost all meaning at this point. People are there. People are gone. I'm lost in my own house wondering around trying to find that lying blanket of a whore when I pass by the bathroom and I catch a glimpse of her. I spring into the room trying to surprise her when I realize that what I saw was a towel hanging up. She's crafty and skilled at hiding. 

Part of my somewhat functional brain remembers I have to work so I manage to escape the labyrinth that was my two bedroom house and attempt to get there. The problem was my car was invisible. I'm starting to think the blanket-towel-lady is also invisible. Guess I have to walk to work. Not sure how I'm going to get there considering a block into my walk I am now in a different town I grew up in. 

Someone called in my stupid lost ass to the cops . I was playing hopscotch on the sidewalk during a Midwest winter, wearing only my shorts and a shirt, while covered in my own blood when multiple patrol cars pulled up. They were asking me questions but the majority of my responses apparently weren't intelligible as I was speaking like Boomhauer from King of the Hill. I also couldn't focus because the shriners were in town and driving their silly little cars around us. Only I could see them which was a nice change of pace from shit hiding from me. 

Then I grew a tail and did as all would do and started chasing it in circles while the Shriners drove around us and the cops were left most likely questioning their life choices that led them to this point. They then inform me that I need to be treated at the hospital but I declined because I didn't have insurance. They said the alternative was jail so I accepted the ambulance ride strapped down to a gurney for ""my safety"". 

Once at the hospital I'm given drug tests, of which I found out later I only tested positive for weed, an MRI, and spent the next few days in ICU until I was stable. I remember my mom showing up and she brought me a BLT for a snack. I try to grab it to take a bite but it was actually her hand.

During the rest of my time at the hospital the hallucinations were far more tame since I was coming down. Brown cats were actually brown napkins, black puppies running past my doorway were actually black wheels of a cart, and there weren't actually mice on top of my TV. I hope. 

I ended up suffering a TBI to my frontal lobe from repeatedly slamming my dome into a solid door to break it down after being locked in my room, several lacerations to my head and body from the window and taking a spill down the stairs, tens of thousands in medical debt, having to relearn to read since words were beyond jumbled for awhile after, and one fucking stupid experience to share whenever this question gets asked. There is a reason why so many hard drug users would never willingly touch this stuff."	neg
"No single turning point, but several things over time. For me the very first moment was when he kept insisting that our world is a simulation based on incredibly flimsy logic and everybody was just like, ""oh yes yes good point Mr. Musk"". Like, I don't have a strong opinion on the idea, but I was sort of turned off by how he had somehow risen above scrutiny at that moment.

Then came the Thai cave rescue incident. I wasn't bothered by him trying to contribute resources to help, even if nobody had asked for it. But the false accusation, calling his critic a ""pedo guy"" IIRC and everything that followed in that story was a big issue.

Then came the Cybertruck. That thing is ridiculous on a practical level, in so many ways.

Then came the actions he took immediately after purchasing Twitter. A lot of really bad business decisions and really poor treatment of people."	pos
"I liked him when he was focused on making green energy affordable. I remember when he came out with the Tesla Solar Roof, and I thought it was very cool. I still think it's a great idea.

The turning point for me was when he became more political, when he started going down the ""anti-woke"" and conspiracy theorist path. I noticed that the type of people that were rallying around him were not the kind of people I like or even agree with. And Musk kept doubling down, to the point where he bought Twitter and lost all that money. It just became extremely obvious that he's very thin-skinned and he's the type of person that can never admit he's wrong about anything. Then, of course, he started letting his racism and anti-semitism slip out, but I was way past my turning point by then."	pos
"When I first started hearing about Elon Musk it was essentially that he was the ""genius visionary founder of Tesla"" and I thought: ""Wow, this guy sounds pretty cool."" I don't know anything about electric cars so when he talked about it, it all sounded pretty smart. I think the Tesla wall and solar roof are really cool ideas.

Then he was the ""genius visionary founder of SpaceX"" and I thought: ""Man, he sounds like a modern day Thomas Edison."" I don't know much about space flight so when he talked about it, it all sounded pretty smart.

Then he bought Twitter. I do know a bit about software development so when he talked about ""Re-implementing the entire tech stack"" and disabling micro-services to save money, I realized that he had no fucking idea what he was talking about. Charging a fee so that anyone can get a verified check mark shows a fundamental misunderstanding about the platform.

Then he just kept talking and talking, and my impression of him continued to drop. Then I found out that he didn't actually found Tesla and doesn't even have a STEM background.

He still won't shut up. COVID, the cave rescue thing, the ""woke"" stuff, Ukraine..."	pos

"In 1996, I was 6 years old and a friend told me that computer mouse balls were worth as much as gold. Stupidly and with no plan, I stole one from the classroom computer. Our teacher got extremely angry and I got really, really scared Id get caught. He had us all leave the room and go in one by one so that whoever stole it could anonymously put it back. I was too scared that somebody might see so I didnt put it back. He exploded on us. The next day, I was going to try to secretly return it, but a kid randomly emptily confessed that HE was the one who stole it and his mom went to the store to buy a new one. He stood in front of the class with a written apology and everything. I should have taken a stand and said No, Kyle! You didnt steal it, I did! Shameful. Anyway, 28 years later, Kyle is a stripper at a gay nightclub."	neg

"You can make yourself less ugly. Sounds like a self-image issue. Start a skincare routine, shave your beard regularly  if you cant grow a nice one, and if you are balding just own it and shave your head, it will look way way better than bringing attention to the bald spot with hair. My dad went bald at 19 and rocked a shaved head the rest of his life, and he was a good looking dude. The jawline stuff is not as big a deal as the internet wants you to believe. Buy some clothes that make you feel good about your looks, stay on top of your hygiene, and keep at the gym, and the confidence (and romantic partners) will come with time."	pos
Ever work on your rizz though?	neg
"Fuck your mom, from the bottom of my heart.

No offense to you but someone asking that from anyone, especially their own kid, has no self regulation. Seriously, that is fucking horrible. There is NO good reason for that, not even if she wants to 'teach you a lesson' or some crap.

Unless there is a GENUINE reason, along the lines of, she loaned you 10 grand a few months ago, there is nothing okay about this.

Buy a van or wagon and live in that for a while, until you find an affordable place. Anything to get out of where you are. If you cant afford that because of what you pay her, any chance you can stay at a friends' place for a month? A thousand bucks would be enough to get you something, two would be enough for something good.

I lived in a wagon for a good while, from experience, a van to stand up in is MUCH nicer as a longer term thing. A wagon is nice to sleep and work in but in terms of actually treating it as a sort of house, a van is nicer.

Minivan with foldable or removable rear seats works too."	pos
"I'm sure you've already thought of this but moving out is your best bet. Also, I'd bring this up when retirement home talks come up but I'm just petty.

Depending on where you live, see if public transport is an option. Also, again depending on where you liven it sounds like you travel frequently so I'd try to get an alternative to Uber since that's just burning your money. Car is the most obvious but most expensive but look into E-Bikes (I got one for my first 2 years of college for like $130 at walmart).

Saving should be easy (aside from the chunk your mom takes)  if you have no other expenses. Also, does she not allow you to eat food she buys or is that responsibility all on you?

If she's feeling reasonable you could also ask if you can exchange household tasks for a lower fee (cleaning, cooking, fixing things, etc.) But if she asked this, idk.

Good luck to you. Regardless it's gonna be a waiting game cause $1300 a month wouldn't really get you a rental anywhere anytime soon."	pos

B) relax, enjoy yourself. You are not your sister, and you are not your mom. 

C) you'll need to become more independent from your mom at some point in your life and you can't live your life just making her happy forever.

yea that's a good thing.  back in the day you could just buy her from her dad and she was automatically wife material because she couldn't vote or have a job or credit card and you could just rape her when you wanted and kick her ass if she talked back to you.  

wait so why are you mad?  tell us which of those things you want to do.  which of those things are you mad you can't do?  which one?"	neg

"Hes not wrong but its a bit of an oversimplification to say its purely racist. White southerners are viewed as stupid, wrong, or uneducated when they speak non academic English.

Shit, I went to college in Texas and found myself falling into the same kind of thought processes every time one of my professors said they were fixin to give out homework.

Even something as simple as an accent does the same thing. People view someone with an accent as dumb or stupid for not speaking properly while completely glossing over the fact that that person is conversing with you in a language not their own.

The racial inequalities certainly crank this kind of language judging to max but its wildly oversimplifying to say its just racially based."	neg
"I am not sure if correcting a word pronunciation is necessarily racist. 

I understand the point and I agree.

As a white person, I have been corrected for pronunciation from my elders several times.

I have been corrected for liberry before. I was corrected very publicly for my mispronunciation of ""fo paux"" and I am not French. 

I also am fluent in American Sign Language. If I missign, I am corrected. 

I am learning ancient and modern Greek. If I mispronounce a word, I am corrected. 

I don't think this is inherently a racist thing. Perhaps I am looking at this too innocently. 

I love looking at how language has evolved since proto-endo-european roots. 

For example a good difference would be the American word ""schedule"" and the British ""schedule"" was because of the French invasion of England. 

English adopts words from other languages which is why it is so complex. 

The British pronounce the ""sch"" the French way and Americans adopted the Greek chi. 

If I go to England and pronounce it the American way, I am wrong because linguistics evolved differently and I am sure the British would correct my mispronunciation. 

Communication is our strength in this world. Learning how to properly communicate with others will reduce confusion and misunderstandings. 

While I, personally, know that ""I need a ride to the store to get pants"" means something completely different in the UK, others may not. 

Academic speak also eliminates the white people from the deep south. Arguably, those are the same people who would feel the most passionately about having a language Litman's test. 

If I shake my head and say ""Nay"" and you are from Greece, is it considered consent in America?"	pos
"I stuck with it the entire way, the kid is like 80% right. He is right in everything he said. However, the teacher at the start either did not understand the book or is poor at expressing the contents. The topic of transition words does fit the narrative. However (yes love that word) she does say sources and thesis and doesn't explain why they are wrong. And I disagree heavily with that point.

To me the structure of an Essay is not white, it is white made and it is white refined. However, it is a natural progression of storytelling from all forms of culture. A small intro with leading facts and characters, a larger deeper journey into those facts and characters, a conclusion to facts and characters, and then sources of facts if meant to illustrate data.

This is just how stories evolved and it is how we structure because it makes sense and is easy for all to follow.

What I am saying is I find all parties correct except the teacher. She explained it poorly and it confused others and she had some points I do find incorrect, and others I'd say are fine."	pos

"I 100% agree. My only other thought, and this was a big part of why my friend broke up with his girlfriend. She had emotional needs that he was working hard on satisfying. He was the busy one in the relationship, but put in the extra effort. He was still unhappy with the results and she wanted more than what he's been doing. 

I asked one question. ""Okay, so you've told me what you've done for her. What has she done to satisfy your needs?"" He never thought about that. He's a people pleaser and he went through everything to make her happy, but she never was. He was always concerned at the fact that he wasn't considering her needs, that he didn't notice she wasn't even making any effort.

Long ass way to say, some people don't deserve your effort when they don't intend to meet you halfway. If I feel unloved and unwanted in my own relationship, how am I supposed to make an effort to satisfy her emotional needs? If you are in a relationship and you feel you need to bend over backwards to make your SO happy, they will never be happy and neither will you."	pos
"A fair point, no doubt, and a valid one.

But only one reason among countless that can arise, seeing as every single relationship is unique in some way."	neg

"Men, if you see this happening - there are 2 responses and neither of them are to ignore it.

1) Go up to her and say ""oh my god! It's been so long! Fancy seeing you here! How's your mom doing?"" And then proceed to allow her the direction of conversation, she may use a fake name or call you her cousin/uncle whatever. Go with it. Then when she feels safe just let her be, it'll have been a traumatic experience so she won't always be ok talking about it with a stranger.

2) Call it out, go to her (not him) but position yourself between them and ask if she's ok and if he's bothering her. This is more confrontational but will likely get a response from him of leaving immediately.

Please don't ignore this behaviour, ever. It's the only way we can actually make women feel safe. If they see men ignoring this kind of thing, it doesn't help anything."	neg

"Ok yeahs its kinda weird hes not getting that its not a hard ban, but tbh it does piss me off that this is the issue we could get 81% of congress to agree on. I feel like it is just a way for an American company to become the overlords fucking with our generation and reaping the profits. So yeah its aggravating that our country is drowning, but this is the issue they can agree on. Man is weird though"	pos
"So, a few things...

1. This is not a ""ban"" of tiktok. It's a forced sell off of the American portion of the company to an American owner, essentially. This is not, and should not be, a controversial move regarding a major social media app owned by a key American security adversary. TikTok does not have to be banned, bytedance(?) just has to sell the American portion of the company off to be fully managed by a company that isn't based out of China with the same security risks. No big deal, this has happened with apps before, and tiktok will continue on in the USA, just under different oversight. (this is a rough simplification, point is, there is no ""tiktok ban"")
2. The complaint about ""81% of congress approving it"" is one that might seem intuitively salient, but isn't really founded in any reality. For one, this is not the first time in so long that a bill has gotten wide support like this. It's not uncommon for congress to pass things bipartisanly, they are just usually not big name actions that get attention. On a different note though, there isn't wide public opinion resisting this. Polling generally shows that at best for tiktok, the public is split 3 ways on this. About 30% support a ban, about 30% oppose a ban, and about 30% don't care. Other polls reflect even greater support for a ban (though, reminder, this bill is not a ban). Even among the majority of those who oppose a ban, this is not a big issue for most people. Very few voters are getting up in arms and changing their vote based on a tiktok ban It's not something many care about. ALSO, I get people are complaining about congress not getting big stuff done, but keep in mind that this country is about the most divided it's been in the last 100 years. THE PEOPLE, not just congress, are heavily split on numerous key policy issues. No one should expect much massive change and new policy when the country can't even agree on who won the last election, just something to consider. Believe it or not, congress generally serves the people, and the people are very divided right now. 

Hope this helps clear things up. This guy in the video is a big time rage bait farmer. Things are rarely as simple as he has explained them as."	neg

"Two choices were made that I can understand.

The young man looking out for the safety of someone he thought was in danger and his older brother choosing to look like an extra in biography of a serial killer from the 80s."	neg
"You could tell that cop was getting real fuckin fed up with the dipshit dad and brother.

Yes this a waste of his time. But this was an opportunity to commend a kid for doing the right thing, the wrong way. Being concerned about another person and their safety is extremely commendable of this young boy. Wanting to make sure that person gets helpnif they need it is important and something he should never lose.

While calling 911 isn't the best idea. Talking to a parent is. And even, if you know where a person lives and what their name is reporting a potential case of abuse to the non emergency line isn't a bad idea. Police can reach out to police there for a welfare check.

This was a learning opportunity for a young person who has a lifetime of internet encounters ahead of him. Instead he gets idiot parents and siblings alienating him and making it else likely for him to say something the next time he sees or hears it."	pos
The dad giving fist bumps to the cops is the icing on the cringe cake. I hope this kid doesnt grow up to be like his brother or dad.	pos
"Based on his family being so shitty in this video, you can see he's used to getting picked on. No wonder he has strong protection instincts. Grade A human surrounded by shit-tier ones."	neg
F that dad and that brother. This kid shouldn't be shamed for caring about another person's well-being.	pos

"I know it is easy to clown on these people for obvious reasons, but I find it to be really sad. These men are so distraught about their standing in life that they feel that forking over $18k for a fake man boot camp is worth it. I am sure there is likely a common thread of loneliness, envy, sexual repression and societal dysfunction that drives these men to pay someone to yell in their face and belittle them. 

Being a military veteran and going through actual boot camp and war I know they yearn for camaraderie. Relationships that are forged and deep, but they continue to wade through shallow relationships that return little meaning to their lives.

They won't find the success they crave paying these snake oil salesman, but through continuous self-improvement, reflection and grace."	neg

We lost  music super star Toby Keith this year to cancer and he was getting better had even begun to tour again. Once again,  Fuck cancer"	neg

Its hard to catch and its so important to be vigilant. I hope the best for Olivia and her family "	pos
"Jesus, thats scary, specially knowing she couldve easily missed it for such a long time if her doctor hadnt been proactive 

On a grimmer note, it really remind you how paywalled life saving medical care is. Most doctors wont do the bare minimum, let alone go the extra mile, because of a variety of factors. But paying big $$ for a professional that has the time, energy, and will to do their work well really does save you from a ton of close calls. Everyone should get the type of care Olivia got, but it sucks to know a regular person wouldve probably caught it too late

Oh ETA a lighter bit: maybe this explains the could-be-engagement ring pic. I can imagine the possibility of the mother of your child dying could make someone feel differently about that person"	pos

Deschanel's father is Caleb Deschanel, a cinematographer who has worked on movies including The Lion King, The Patriot, My Sister's Keeper and The Passion of Christ. He also has credits on other classics including The Godfather and Titanic.

ur asking like any of us have seen girls w/ out clothes	pos
Imo yes. I guess that's why lingerie is such a successful business	pos
"Depends on clothes imo. I think hot isn't really what I'm most attracted to though; I think things like hot, cute, pretty, beautiful are all quite different; hot is the least appealing to me.

I think less clothes becomes gradually more hot (up until nudity; somehow it gets less hot when fully nude).

The most appealing look, though, is stuff like baggy hoodies. For sure."	pos
has anyone here actually seen girls without clothes irl?	neg
"Try calling, some ppl are just dry af and why try to make him jealous? Yall are wasting both of your time I would txt him that this isnt working out and yall should move on"	neg

id advise u to not do games like that bc the guys tht u should date dont play those games

also, as someone mentioned, dont make sth out of nth. if he doesnt text u just ask him instead of doing what u did. u couldve worked it out if he genuinely didnt know it was a problem, but ofc theres a chance he was also playing games. if thats the case, its better tht nth happened imo, dont need that type of ppl in ur life

to answer the question in the title, no, we text unless were EXTREMELY shy. but i dont think the guy likes u (idk him so i cant say for sure but ik i wouldnt)

and finally, i want to congratulate u for being able to ask for advice. not many ppl have the courage to do so"	pos

For me tbh I would never wanna be skinny or fat I'm like right in between I would never be skinny cuz it just looks weird to me but I think as long as your not 200+ pounds and not muscular it wouldn't be a problem 	pos
Something small and subtle can look really good especially if it goes with your style. I've seen people who have multiple nose piercings and that is not attractive imo. Also not a big fan of septum piercings. But the most important thing is for you to do what makes you happy and looks good in your opinion :)	pos
"I use a watch to check the time, so I don't have to dig my phone out of my pocket every time, just a quick flick of the wrist and I know what time it is.

And your dad's right, I had never worn a watch when I got mine as a gift, but after a week I barely noticed it, and now it almost feels weird to not wear one"	pos
"i wear my dads old watch. it stopped ticking the exact moment my cat died 10 years ago so my dad never got it fixed (also it would be more expensive to repair it than to replace it). it sounds corny but whenever i wear the watch it feels like shes with me, idk"	neg
"I wear a watch almost everyday, the most part of my wrist that I wear my watches on is a different shade to the rest of my arm . Watches are a good way to accessorize and silver watches go so hard with silver rings"	pos

"My mom did this(admittedly it was a little different in my case) to me all the time when I was growing up, of course it was during my birthday- which happens to be the 24th.

So I got Link to the Past for my birthday, and an SNES for christmas.

Final Fantasy 7 for my birthday, and a Playstation for Christmas.

I realized at a young age that my mom was very adept at psychological torture."	neg
"Some things you can use that with;  

A computer with Bluetooth capabilities  

An android phone that is android 10 or newer   

Probably and apple phone too  

  

It's essentially a super fancy bluetooth controller, enjoy it!

"To be fair, there's nothing stopping from big players to standardize controller interfaces, and then compete on controller features, while the controllers being usable on any device (like mice and keyboards).

Brand exclusivity, planned obsolescence, and vendor lock-in also has something to do with this situation."	pos
"Reminds me of the time I got a Luigi's Mansion player guide as one of my first gifts, thinking that a gamecube and the game were among my pile of presents. I got a lot of clothes that day but no gaming console or game was unwrapped."	neg
It's still a sick controller to use with pc games. Download ds4windows and get that shit rockin.	neg
"I dont own a playstation (never have) and have two dualshock 4 controllers, i use it with PC and its quite good with Steam..."	pos
Steam and Ds4Windows (ryochan7 not the jays2kings one) has support for it. There are mods for almost every game to change the button prompts from xbox to ps. Also some games have native support for it without steam or Ds4Windows.	pos
The thought counts! My friends got me ps5 games as a surprise but I still need one as well. Scalpers stole Christmas this time. Happy Holidays!	pos
My dad got me a Cold War hard drive instead of the game	neg

Suddenly. He started yelling again but it was getting louder. I turned back around and he was running at the same speed as my horse through the trees and rocks to keep up next to me until he finished his spiel and finally started walking slowly again. It freaked me the fuck out. I have it saved on my Xbox if I can find a way to upload it. "	neg

She asked my name, I asked hers. Then someone else on the team typed to her ""hey i'm trying to play dota, can you suck his dick after the game"".

This is why guys like this ask  ""why do no women play dota?"""	pos
"My sister never really talk or write anything that could give her teammates any hint that she is a girl because of that. 

At first I didn't understood why some girls wanted to be in some ""Girls team/guild only"". Now I think it's a good place for girls to play online without having to deal with that kind of guy."	pos
"It's so annoying. Guys clearly just play games for attention. Gaming has always been for girls. If a guy is a gamer it's only because he wants girls to like him. He just wants to seem quirky.

See how dumb that sounds?"	pos
"this is why im glad Im not a teenage gamer anymore. Me and everyone I game with are 25-35 and we never have these issues and a good portion of our community are women. Its sucks that my favorite hobby is so full of children who think ""get back in the kitchen"" jokes are top tier big brain humor."	pos
"I've been gaming since I was in middle school and I've always been very careful about mentioning gender when I play online. The amount of harassment is just not worth it. The few games I've played open mic with I was sure to do with a few other gaming girls. Guys seem less willing to be a prick if there's more than one girl in a group. That being said the number of requests to aol/msn messenger, skype, facetime ect that I got in direct messaging was always intense.

Now that I'm married it's a whole different thing. When guys find out I'm a chick and tell them I'm married suddenly is HIGHLY offensive to them. Like how dare I not be just single and waiting for them to come alone and sweep me off my feet. Lots of requests for ""just some pics, he doesn't have to know"" like I'd ditch a perfectly happy marriage for some random jackass on the internet.

I've mostly transitioned to offline games, more because they fit what I'm into lately but I definitely don't miss the gamer dudes.


All that aside, I've met some really cool guys in most of the games I play who are just there to game. I feel like the nice ones probably even outnumber the assholes so while the gaming community is super fucking hostile, I think it's getting better (or I'm just playing games with less asshole. Your mileage may vary)"	pos
"As someone who plays mostly single-player games or co-op, this shit is stupid common. Every time Ive been in a public lobby that has a girl in it at least one person is losing their shit and constantly trying to talk to them and get their attention. Can we not just play the damn game and speak to everyone the same?

I think the biggest issue that stems from this is how discouraged women become from entering gaming communities or the industry itself. Gamer guys really out here cucking themselves."	neg
"I can still remember watching my friend say something like this to a girl on xbox live when we were like 16/17, I cringed so hard I'm surprised I didn't break my back. 

He thought he was being their knight in shining armour against the other guys playing MW2, I get that MW2 lobbies were bad but lord that was terrible"	neg
"A girl gamer enters the lobby

Boys: soooo how long have you been a girl?"	pos
"Tbh last time I was aware there was a girl in a game, they were constantly berated by somebody on the other team for their gender. They just didn't respond, ended up getting MVP, whilst the abuser went down a rabbit hole of pointless insults then offered me a 1v1 when I asked him to pack it in - I declined, saying his ego was fragile enough as it is, I wouldn't want to make him cry harder.

Gotta love that friendly online multiplayer experience!"	neg
"Honestly, boys who do this thing to girls are either immature or just flat-out weird. Like, I dont care if your a lad or a lass, I just care about if your gonna help the team get the win."	pos
Dude my wife gets messages all the time.  The amount of Hey sorry for killing you I didnt mean that at all lol.  Lmao yeah haha hilarious bro so funny.  Kick rocks zzzz.	pos
"I play RDR2 online, and as with any game, if I'm gonna stare at a character it may as well be a female one, and I took a lil time in the creating process and made my character (IMHO) pretty.

The number of guys I get gathering around me to harass me because the character looks female is so annoying. I key up my Mic and deeply say ""Yea, I'm not a real girl""

I couldn't imagine how much harassment would increase if it was a girly voice they heard asking them to be left alone."	neg
"Most kids think they want this to happen until it happens for real as harassment. How do I know? Well, there was a ""Only women"" school close to where I used to study and if a young high schooler would pass when they were out, they would all scream things, it was crazy, all females, screaming, whistling and calling the guys names like ""Little daddy""

Most kids would be tomato red and pass fast like they heard nothing.

I remember some dudes would rather walk an extra block to walk around the ladies high school rather than passing in front of it.

So no, most of the sad kids saying ""I wish it was like that"" only wished one beautiful woman magically talked to them, not to be harassed the way so many women are harassed online."	pos
"This is why i never mention my gender online... I'm only 14 and I've had so many grown ass men saying such disgusting sexual shit to me and saying blatantly misogynistic things through the mic. :/

Edit: I forgot to mention this, but what is really fucking annoying is when they find out you're a girl and they start *targeting* you or even gang up on you, then say shit like ""you can't play because you're a girl"" or whatever. It's not funny, it's just rude. The earliest I've experienced sexism online is when I was playing a roblox game when I was around idk, 9? 10?? Poor little me ended up tearing up."	neg
"I hate going on mic cause Im a girl, I usually just get rude objectifying comments and always are you single? not even as a joke.

She spent the next half a dozen matches coaching me and helping me improve. I thanked her and then she said no offense but Im gonna unfriend you nowend on a good note.

"This is a strategy which once failed for my parents one Christmas Eve.

I was given a slot car racer track, and because we were driving to the other grandparents house on Christmas day, I was told I could stay up until I crashed. The other thing to know, which properly frames the situation, is that the power distribution for a track like this is flawed. When you squeeze the trigger for both controllers, and there are two cars on the track, the power is distributed pretty evenly, but if one of the cars is knocked off the track or your opponent releases their trigger to break suddenly, then that power is instantaneously transferred to the other car and car number 2 sees a comparable boost in acceleration and velocity for the exact same applied trigger pressure.

When I went to college I studied Electrical Engineering, and it makes sense as both tracks are wired in parallel, but at the time, it was just known as the method to knock your opponent from the track. Both racers accelerate so they are going as fast as they can without getting thrown from the track, then just before your opponent enters a turn, you drop your throttle and watch as your opponent now finds themselves accelerating into a turn.

For the rest of the evening my Father tried in vain to knock me from the track. He used every dirty trick he could, and because of the way the cars power were distributed, it often meant I could cause his plans to backfire. I'm sure it was only a few minutes that I held on, but to a kid my age it was practically all night."	neg

"I keep saying this to all my friends. What really needs to happen is for E3 to roll around. Let all the video game and console devs do their presentation. Then; when EA steps out, and only when EA steps out, people collectively 'boo' and turn their backs throughout the whole presentation. The only thing gamers can do short of buying absolutely 0 EA games (unlikely) which would tank stocks, is to show them their actions have reached a pinnical of disappointment for their consumers. That gamers wont even be bothered to be aware/present at their biggest yearly exposition.

Edit: even I can't believe THIS is my top rated comment. I always assumed ""RIP inbox"" was a joke.

Edit #2: Ok so since this is still a comment people are latching onto and I have access to my computer now, I guess I should make as few things a little clearer. I know it's all paid-to-clap press. Those people are paid to write 'best in E3 show!' 'Battlefront 2 made me cry!' '#newEAgamelooksdope' bias is part of their resume. 'Yes man' their label. My point is that it would have to get to that moment where even the paid to gold seal 'reporters' have had enough. Sadly, there will never be a universal ban on one publisher. For those who've been in a guild, it's common knowledge gamers rarely will work together for the better of the whole without having their ego stroked as the one. I would assume this applies double for trying to ban a publisher. At this point, all you can do is the single most damaging thing to a major corporation; and that is to tank their stocks. Their PR will kiss shit stained player ass and do it with a smile. That's their job. What we need to start thinking as a whole collective is how to make their stock holders and CEO's start applying rose red lipstick and considering their go-to tongue action move. This means, actively boycotting all their products. Which nobody will do. I'm favor of a comment I saw where someone suggested, as far as Battlefront II was concerned, attack Disney. I agree with u/roxwar. >EA doesnt own star wars, Disney does and if theres one thing Disney absolutely will not tollerate, its bad press surrounding their brand. You want to punish EA? Then you need to take to social media and tag disney in this shitshow and express your disgust at their assosiation with gambling boxes in video games obviously aimed at children.

I'd assume Disney saw the EA stocks and figured they could do no wrong. Disney stopped selling magic and childhood dreams mid-80's. What the fuck do they know about fun and happiness (anybody who points to their theme parks have clearly never stood 4-hours in line for a five minute ride)? That does mean however, we need to stop the cycle of being the industries bitches. Take some fucking responsibility. In many ways; these practices became practical to them because gamers (us) showed them that it was a viable business model. Like paying for a gold subscription on Xbox. DLC that is a few skin changes for guns or characters. Sloppy/shoddy/irrelevant pre-order bonuses. Games that were released buggy because a deadline had to be met (yet are rarely fixed once the cash in comes) If we as gamers want a more responsible publisher and game dev; we must become more responsible consumers of games. We must learn to adult as gamers."	pos

"I officially began my EA boycott last year.  It started with NHL.  My buddies and I are hockey mega fans, and we loved teaming up on the EA Sports Hockey League.  We got the game every year... always hype for the early release in September!  But then nothing in the game was ever improving, the game felt worse with each release.  Each iteration of the game felt like a dumb downed recycled version of the last.  Every year the game felt more random and we were losing actual control of of our players.  Frustration finally led to all of us not buying 17.  My brother tried the 18 beta and was like yeah nevermind I know why we stopped.  


The only thing they update and care about is their HUT bullshit.  Because people drop stacks to buy more and more card packs.   Our boycott hurts, I miss hockey, but I finally decided after 4 years of declining user experience it was finally time.  Maybe one day EA will release a hockey game again that isn't so focused on micro transactions.  Or better yet maybe another company can make a damn hockey game.


Anyway we are much happier gamers right now living it up in Rainbow Six Siege.  Fuck you EA, and fuck you rammalammadingdong.  I miss my hockey."	neg

"I had a Chocolate Lab I named Bubbles whom I absolutely loved. We'd do everything together. Growing up on a Farm on the prairies was awesome for a big dog like that.

fast forward a few years: I had to move to the East Coast. It was a tough decision but I couldn't bring him to a new area with barely any space to roam (35 by 35 lot versus hundreds of acres to roam).

Fast forward a few visits back every year for 3 years. He wasn't getting as much exercise and age was getting to him. I would always ask about him when I phoned my parents. My Mom and Dad were worried about his health so we decided we should make an appointment for him.

I remember flying 3400 kms plus back home to put my dog down. My new gf at the time also flew out after her rotation. We walked with him for a bit. His arthritis was super bad so I moved heavy stuff out of his way and he was just so happy to be walked by us. I spent the day with him, fed him some big chunks of steak and laid with him on his pillow.

The next morning We knelt on the blanket while the needle was used and I feel like he instantly knew what was happening. He was very weak at this time. 11 years 10 months old. He hobbled over and collapsed on my lap looking up at me. I was so happy to be there for him.

Everytime I think about him or about us being in the room when he was put down I cry. I don't regret it though. I think if you are willing to raise a pet you should be there for then at the end. No question.

Edit: that gf became my wife! I had a puppy before meeting her and now we have two dogs and a cat."	pos

I hugged her just like the reaper did here, except I would scratch her sides to make her perk her head up and lick the air like a snake all the time. We were inseparable, her and I. She literally slept with me, either in between my legs or under my arm with her head resting on my shoulder.


It kills me to know she was scared and I wasn't able to be there for her in her last moments. It tears me apart. So this hits too close to home for me. Too soon for me too.

"Some history in that it wasn't solely an evangelical thing. Evangelicals have always had a hate-hate relationship with pop culture, but D&D panic became mainstream a little bit due to the general ""Satanic panic"" craze, as well as a specific case with James Dallas Egbert where lawmen incorrectly speculated D & D drove his behavior (a failed suicide attempt.) The old movie Mazes and Monsters is a fictionalized retelling of that case.

The Satanic Panic in general is something that tends to be forgotten now. People believed that there were cabals of satanists around that abused children and did other nasty things, due to a couple trials that heavily relied on the now discredited idea of repressed memories. This was mostly a secular idea. The meme joke ""show me on the doll where he touched you"" came from this, but was used along with leading questions to get vulnerable kids to confess to being abused in utterly bizarre and false ways. It's something that reads like it was straight out of fiction, but it really happened in the 1980s, and D&D was close enough to get hit in the crossfire from it.

It happened mostly as a reaction to the rise of mass media and the pretty harsh amount of social change we saw in the 80s. It's actually scarier that it was forgotten so quickly; if you grew up in that time, the fact that people literally thought it existed, and that it shaped pop culture in not a few ways, has always troubled me. It actually affected Christian fundamentalist belief in that it spawned the ""spiritual warfare"" trope and heightened belief in the existence and power of demons to influence people's behavior. A good example of this is in the novel ""This Present Darkness"" by Frank Peretti, which was my generation's Left Behind. And people actually milked this behavior; the Christian comedian Mike Warnke among others actually claimed to be ex satanists of the moral panic variety.

It's really a cautionary tale of how people act during times of social panic and what can set them off. It's not actually religion alone; religious people opposed the advent of the bar code, for one, and never saw the level of demonization at the secular level we did with D&D. (Though we do have to thank them for really linking bar codes with dehumanization, for example; sometimes religious critique can actually be dead on in emotional tone, while not on facts.) But if secular people on the whole are vulnerable, you get these ideas transmitted widespread.

Just posting this if you think parents forbidding people from playing D&D is solely hyper religious nutcases. A lot of secular people fell for it too, and its too easy to fall into the idea that normal people can't fall prey to moral panic ideas.

"EA was given essentially the holy grail of game franchises: A developed universe with huge, open lore that's almost universally well-known, suited to almost any sort of game, with a solid, invested fanbase with deep pockets. 

Which is why I think they stumbled so badly, and why I think a lot of other publishers will struggle with this.

Monetization is something game developers are learning they have to use in moderation to avoid poisoning otherwise good games. But they don't *want* moderation. They want the $70 game with the $160 Collector's Edition with paid DLC, microtransactions, loot boxes and a monthly subscription fee.

Even *Star Wars* can't support the amount of monetization they want. But it comes closer than almost any other property, and that temptation is like dangling black tar heroin in front of a hardcore drug addict.

Combine that with the industry's increasing inability to properly project manage a game from start to finish, typically collapsing into a spasm of crunch and a buggy, unpolished release, and I strongly suspect we're going to see more than a few more disasters."	neg

"Except preordering doesn't affect the quality of a game nor does it rush anything out the door because preorders are not final sales and the company that creates the games gets zero revenue from it unless you buy direct. And even then it generally doesn't charge you until release day. It's a silly scapegoat that the internet created for a perceived lack of quality in modern games that both invents a nonexistent problem and comes up with a solution to it that wouldn't even address that problem if it were real.

The actual problem is that games are corporate now. They aren't labors of love made by nerds in a dank basement. They're made by billion dollar corporations with 100 million dollar budgets and the concern is more with investors and the bottom line than quality of product. In cases where games are rushed, it's because of this. Blaming preorders for that is just inane. 

Case in point. When Cyberpunk's original release date was announced by the corporate side, there were people working on the game that couldn't believe it because they thought it needed 2 more years. At that point, the game was not preorderable."	neg

"A good buddy of mine is not ""a gamer"" like I have been most of my life.  He spends all of his time working hard on his car parts business or on his personal cars during his free time.  But, when he had a chance to accompany a mutual friend to Germany to pick up a bmw, my friend decided to build a pc racing rig. His only pcs til this point had been for work.  This would be his second trip with our friend to pick up a bmw from the factory.  He regretted not being able to drive as fast as he wanted to on the Nurburgring during the first time, because he was unfamiliar with the track and he didn't want to risk his friend's new car.  So, in preparation for their next trip, years later, using some of his car parts to build the rig, got his staff to build him a computer make a steam account, he dedicated a lot of his free time across several months to practice driving only the Nurburgring track, on Project Car. And it was funny seeing him on steam, putting hours on Project Car every day, while I played PUBG or something else.  When he finally arrived at the Nurburgring, he was able to drive my friend's new M car the way he felt most satisfying and knew the track pretty well.  When he returned from Germany, he never used the rig again, and probably won't until he goes back to Germany.  I introduced a phone game called Zookeeper to this same friend, maybe a decade ago, before the trips to Germany.  We would play it together when our group would get together. We would laugh how we were only in 500,000th place. Again, this guy doesn't play games normally, and I stopped playing Zookeeper not long after I introduced it to him.  Years later, I learn that he still plays it, usually only when he's pooping.  He shows me his zoo.  He's in the top 100, has 100s of power ups that he never uses, and hundreds of all the things you can collect.  Not long after that he was in the top 10.  I tell this story because I think it's interesting how a driven person can exceed in almost everything, even if it's a silly thing like a computer game.  I am not driven like he is,  I play for fun, though sometimes I wish I was a master at a game like PUBG, but I'm exhausted after work and my wife wouldn't appreciate it."	pos

"Everyone, please realise the importance of this. The outrage  should dwarf that against EA. This affects us in the gaming community immensely. 

You're mad about pay to play, gamble packs, microtransactions, and defenseless limitations? Well this repeal has the potential to put all US internet activities into that same ship. It's an attack on the people's internet, and the people themselves. This is modern class warfare, and we're about to be dealt a death blow. 

Our voices may seem insignificant on their own, but look at the attention we were able to bring to the EA situation. We can be louder, we can fight harder, and in this fight, we have allies in every internet community in every corner of the world wide web. If we have any hope of winning this, we must engage, we must reach out, and we must stand with all those who stand against this. 

Let us not allow ourselves to be the generation of sheep and cattle. 

Let us not allow ourselves to be hearded to our demise. 

This is a line we cannot allow to be crossed without severe consequence. Fight! Fight like the life we've grown to love and cherish dependson it, because it absolutely does. 

I'm calling for our mods to reach out to other major subs and start planning action. It's clear now that the enemy won't even bat an eye at words and comments alone, this needs a physical, 'people in the streets' response!

On the other hand I'm glad my country is part of the European Union, and for the existence of European regulations that basically makes the loss of Net Neutrality nowadays simply not possible in my continent. I really hope that USA can get out of this dark period as soon as possible. Hopefully once Mister Trump is out of the Oval office. To those who have fought so much for net neutrality I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed. Bad times may come.

It even cycles through all representatives based on your zip code and then goes to senate majority leaders office as well. 

If you still think you cannot read the script well, I will type out below exactly what to say so you don't have to improvise at all. 

""Hello Senator/Congressman/woman _______, my name is _________ from ________. I am calling today to voice my support for the Title II existing net neutrality rules and I would like you to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Please contact the FCC chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. Thank you for your time.""

Also, I don't know why the ""my name is"" above got bolded. Do not say ""my name is"" like the Eminem song. Be polite. "	pos

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z_nBhfpmk4


https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/the-fccs-myths-vs-facts-sheet-defending-its-plan-to-reverse-net-neutrality-annotated/

""Immediately after FCC Chairman Pai announced his intention to remove the net neutrality rules set in place in 2015, the agency issued a little preemptive strike against detractors. Internet Regulation: Myths vs. Facts. Ive annotated it with a few extra facts.

Myth: Title II regulations are necessary to preserve a free and open internet.

Fact: The internet was free and open prior to the FCC adopting Title II regulations in 2015.

Additional Fact: Internet providers before 2015 also attempted to monitor, modify, block and throttle internet traffic depending on the content, user or application. The internet is free and open post-2015, but with the additional security of these intrusions being illegal, not addressed reactively once discovered, sometimes after years.


Myth: Title II regulations havent reduced infrastructure investment and broadband deployment.
Fact: Among our nations 12 largest internet service providers, domestic broadband capital expenditures decreased by 5.6 percent percent, or $3.6 billion, during the first two years of the Title II era. Title II also has hurt smaller providers ability to get financing and reduced infrastructure investment. In short, Title II has slowed broadband deployment and hampered the FCCs efforts to close the digital divide.

Additional Fact: One could have said the same thing after the FCC classified cable internet as Title I in 2002: investment fell then, too. The statistics above, however, are rather misleading. Many major internet providers have increased spending, or projected the decreases mentioned years ahead of time. This article puts some of the numbers in context, and has the bonus of coming from Free Press, an outlet Pai attempted to discredit today by pointing out that it was a socialist publication  yes, really.

Myth: Title II regulations are good for broadband competition.

Fact: Title II is a regulatory framework designed to regulate the Ma Bell telephone monopoly, not to encourage new entrants into the marketplace. And a regulatory framework designed for a monopoly will tend to push the marketplace toward a monopoly. Smaller, competitive broadband providers do not have the same resources as larger companies to cope with increased regulatory costs and have scaled back broadband deployment as a result of Title II.

Additional Fact: Title II was indeed created a long time ago in a different age  of course, you could say that about practically any law written more than 20 years ago. Laws are made to last for decades, even centuries, with the help of judicial interpretation (in this case, the Supreme Court supported Title II classification) and legislative amendment (in this case, the 1996 Telecommunications Act). It also already applies to many of the companies involved in some fashion; companies like AT&T and Verizon have built their mobile networks under Title II oversight and thrived. Also, as the 2015 order points out, very few sections of Title II are actually being applied. There is also an exemption for smaller ISPs with up to hundreds of thousands of subscribers to avoid exactly this outcome.

Myth: Title II regulations are good for online privacy.

Fact: Title II put Americans online privacy at risk by stripping the Federal Trade Commission of its jurisdiction over broadband providers privacy and data security practices. Ending Title II will restore the FTCs authority and return to a tried-and-true approach that successfully protected consumers privacy prior to 2015. It will put our nations most experienced and expert privacy agency back on the broadband beat.

Additional Fact: Title II did shift authority for privacy and security practices from the FTC to the FCC, which then put stronger rules in place to address some internet provider-specific vulnerabilities. Those stronger rules were repealed before taking effect last month, an action Chairman Pai approved of. Now neither agency is protecting consumers and that isnt likely to change any time soon.

Myth: Title II regulations are good for innovation.

Fact: The Commissions 2015 Title II internet regulations have deterred internet service providers from offering new and innovative services to consumers. For example, 22 small providers, each of which has fewer than about 1,000 customers, has told the FCC that because of Title II each of us has slowed, if not halted, the development and deployment of innovative new offerings which would benefit our customers.

Additional Fact: There is no conceivable innovative new offering that could be brought by an under-1,000-subscriber ISP that would be blocked by the Open Internet Order, which bans paid prioritization, throttling, traffic interference and misleading commercial terms. If it was yet another zero-rating plan, then, as Ive pointed out, the truly innovative offering would be removing data caps.

Myth: Title II regulations are good for free speech and free expression.

Fact: Government regulation is not the friend of free speech, but an enemy. For example, the First Amendment doesnt give the government power to regulate. It denies the government that power. Additionally, greater government regulation of the internet is strongly supported by many who are fundamentally hostile to free speech."""	pos
"I can't even imagine the fall out of what this would actually cause for small businesses, people who work from home to save money, and those who use the internet to help with budgeting etc.  I am scared to see what this country is becoming that this would even be something America would consider.  Very disturbing.  Need to get the word out and get people ""eyes wide open"" on this topic!"	neg
"They targeted gamers.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight."	neg
"As said by Markiplier: (If Net Neutrality dies, you might come to youtube one day and see instead of your videos, you have not purchased the entertainment package for your internet. Buy it with 5 dollars now.) Me: All of a sudden we lose access to everything our games, entertainment, FREEDOM, LEARNING SITES! Then what? How is this supposed to help us? Doing ""the right thing"" is just another way for all of these internet providers to take control of OUR action on the web! If net neutrality dies, the entire internet dies. Period.

"I want to say a couple things about this as I think its important for me to state. I started streaming a few months back. Depression has always been a major problem in my life, and Ive always had poor self esteem. Ive always thought poorly about myself: ""Nobody cares about you. Everything you do is worthless. You're nothing."" General thoughts of self doubt and the thought of suicide are about standard every now and then with this. I was stuck with terrifying thoughts for the longest time until I decided to start streaming. 

I chose one game that i was good at and loved to pieces, Dragons Dogma. Did a couple challenge runs, made things seem interesting. Made about 20 followers in my first couple weeks. ""Twenty followers is still a lot!"" were the first signs that I had found some semblance of happiness and confidence. 

I kept putting in time and time until I finally hit 50 followers and received my affiliate status on Twitch within my first month. I was absolutely ecstatic when I received the email that I would be able to earn income from Twitch. I think that night I cried pretty hard. Harder than I had when my depression had spiked in the past. I had made something out of nothing. 

Fast forward a few months, and 50 followers turn into 280 by the beginning of this next month. These are people who are younger, older, smarter, much more amazing than myself. These are folks who watched my content. Theae are folks who chatted with me in the chat, who decide to spend their points on small trolls for the games that I play, who dedicate even five minutes to stop by and say hello. 
These are folks who decided to follow my Twitch. To follow me.

When I say that I have issues with depression and self confidence, I look back towards the progress I've made on my channel in these past few months. ""Nobody cares about you."" People enjoy my content. ""Everything you do is worthless."" The very same people got my channel up to 50 views when I did a twelve hour live stream for charity. "" You're nothing."" I am something. 

I'm not a wizard with an enchanting voice. I don't have the voice of an angel or whatnot. I may make my followers have a better day, but they're the ones who truly make my days better. 

 I'm certainly not as popular as I've currently made 280 followers in those three months. It's been the longest journey I've ever had, and each day I am absolutely suspended in disbelief at the fact that people chose to watch my content, tune into my channel, and decide to follow me. 

My average viewer counts of zero to an average of six over these past few months mean the world to me. Any gamer who struggles with no viewers watching their stream, persevere. You got this. 

And to the wonderful folks who watch my content, words cannot fathom how much I appreciate all of you. You guys are the best."	pos
"I never thought about doing it (being a 37 y/o dad and all that) but I have played with multiple people online who told me I should do it, simply because they liked my voice.

My wife is my only viewer lol, and when I check on her upstairs she is asleep with her phone on twitch on my channel."	pos

I enjoyed Skyward Sword in 2011, but it's probably my least favorite Zelda. I'm not planning on paying for it again. 

It's the same for Pokemon. Everyone complained about how low-effort Sword and Shield were, and yet they sold 20M copies. So Nintendo has zero incentive to do anything differently."	neg

They also unnecessarily use proprietary cartridges that are significantly more expensive, and force digital price parity. https://www.usgamer.net/articles/nintendo-rules-and-cart-prices-making-switch-games-more-expensive-report

I know nothing so dont take my advice if you want but please:

a) Make the chapters visually different. Journey did that amazingly. Im assuming it will be a linear chapter-based game.

b) Add secondary goals so there is some replay value to each chapter. Dont add collectibles or graded/timed chapter scores. Nobody likes that. Unfinished Swan is an example of a liners game with 0 replay value.

"This may get buried, but I want to put this here anyway. I was first introduced to Halo in the third grade by a good friend of mine from school. He spoke of a Master Chief, an Arbiter, Grunts, Brutes, Spartans, and such things almost every day. They all went completely over my head, but he spoke with such enthusiasm that the words stuck with me for years to come. A time or two he invited me to his house to play Halo 3 on his Xbox 360, and I remember fighting in a private multiplayer party in Mombasa, firing rockets through the big wheel on that map for no real reason other than to screw around and have fun. He left that same year, but I never forgot the fun we had and the name Halo.

Years later, I finished the 10th grade and was moving abroad with my family. With all of my possessions packed away and virtually locked in an Airbnb for the better part of two months, I turned to YouTube. My mind called back to the names of Halo and Red vs. Blue. I put them in the search bar, and my world has been changed ever since.

In the two years since those summer days, I have become enamored with the games, world and community Bungie and 343 have built, but never set foot in them. My parents were always a little stingy about multiplayer games and buying a console when we had a perfectly good PC. So I never played a Halo game except for Halo Wars on a Steam trial weekend. I have looked and continue to look forward to Installation 01, what I once thought was my one chance at playing a Halo FPS on a PC.

Now I hear of this.

I look forward to joining the Halo community as a rookie and perhaps capturing a part of a childhood I never had, and doing my friend from years ago proud."	pos

"My cousin and I play rust together (both in our 40s). We build very elaborated bases with lots of false security doors, pitfalls, etc. 

We were being raided by a kid nightly. He would only blow up a few walls and never got anything. I happened to be on one day and he came by and blew up a wall. I followed him back to his place to see where he was coming from. 

Later that night, my cousin and I went to his house to tell his (there were a few of them) to stop or will make their life on the server miserable. They laughed and told us that their base is impenetrable and they would be back to our base later. 

So my cousin and I worked on our plan. We had so many resources it was ridiculous, so we didnt have to gather anything. 

I went to their base and knocked on the door. When they answered I played We Built This City by Starship through my mic. I was completely naked carrying mother and not a threat.  The opened the door and hit me with an axe, I just stood there and died. I did this dozens of times over the next hour, playing the same song the entire time. They just kept killing me. 

Their humor turned to annoyance and then to anger. They were threatening me with real life bodily harm, pleading with me to stop, saying they would report me, etc.

Eventually their anger turned to acceptance and they would let me In their house for a second or two before they killed me.  

One of these times I noticed that their tool cupboard was not secured. So one of those times I was able to click on it and add myself to the build privileges.  That took a while for them to not notice i was doing it. I just kept running in a circle and eventually got it. 

So, I stopped bothering then after that and went back to wait until they left. When they did leave, we went to their base and build a staircase to a level that wasnt completely built. It still had wood window bars. 

We chopped the window bars out and found two of them sleeping on that floor. We stripped them naked, out gimp masks on them, looted everything in their house, broke all security doors down and put up new doors and locks throughout, broke all beds and sleeping bags and out up a nice painting in their cell for them.   

Their only way out of the house was a plank we put way above the ground. So they had to commit suicide to leave the house and couldnt get back in. 

They got back on the next day and pleaded with us for their things back, which we didnt give them. They laughed and said their next base would be even better and theyd be back. We did the same thing to their new base. They wouldnt let me In this time but they werent very smart players and left a very noticeable security hole. 

They left the server.

"I have like 600 games on Steam.

I remember saying to myself ""wow, I have like... nothing to play. I actually used to wait for months for some of these to come out and now I can't even be bothered to reinstall them"".

What changed?

The answer, I think, is the ""mystery"" of ""what can I do"" in a game.

In the old games, there were SO MANY SECRETS and hidden things and easter eggs and you were always surprised when you walked up to an object a pressed and button and it unexpectedly DID something. Like a nondescript wall moved aside in Wolfenstein to reveal a secret room and you thought ""oh god, ANY wall could be a secret door"".

That small detail rekindled that feeling of adventure in your mind. Since games were so limited, something as simple as picking up a cup from a table in Oblivion and being able to toss it around was mindblowing.

When someone told me Jaws could sometimes block a bullet with his teeth in Golden Eye 007 for N64, we tried for HOURS in multiplayer trying to get it to work.

I remember buoyancy in Half Life 2 blew my mind and the fact that crates broke into pieces when you shot them... and then the pieces also floated. It was like a sandbox of surprises!

Now, I have games like Cyberpunk where shadows and screenshots are sometimes indistinguishable from real life... and yet I'm having LESS FUN.

Why? **Because I already know EXACTLY what I can do.**

It went from mystery and adventure, to **get through these chores so I can level up**. I already know what kind of engine it's in, and what features/mechanics are implemented (or not), and how scripting works, and I know that the scale of the game means many NPCs and objects are procedural and predictable.

Once you know that something is ""all you can do"" in a game, you LOSE that feeling of adventure from years ago.

If game developers want to reintroduce that feeling, they don't need the biggest open world map ever created, or incredible NPC AI, or amazing gunphysics... they need us to wonder what is possible and put the story back in our hands. They need to make the world interactive and immersive and let us just PLAY it, instead of the game playing us through linear cutscenes and story quests on rails."	pos
"I find that when I have time to truly play a game I still get this feeling, but the hard part of being older is finding that time. When you are young you have the time to get absorbed into the world for weeks at a time. Nowadays my gameplay is broken up into short intervals 'once in awhile'. 

When my son was first born I had 7 weeks off of work. I played through RDR2 and BoTW, with him sleeping on me, and I hadn't had such a great gaming experience in a long time."	neg

I especially liked the _Fallout New Vegas_ implementation.  Barebones?  Yes.  But that's a consequence of it being an entirely optional feature.

Who wants to play Bob's Survival Mod, which maybe 1,000 people will use, when there's an official mode that maybe half of the entire playerbase of millions will use?  If I want to play a non-legit tweak of a game, I may as well turn on God Mode and be done with it, for all the legitimacy it carries.

I may be _Fallout 4's_ biggest critic, but I will give Bethesda props for adding their survival mode and especially the very inventive ""dark craving"" idea.  Sometimes I am tempted to give the game another chance just because of the existence of that mode."	pos

"I hope this letter finds you well. I can hear your complaint already, Gordon Freeman, we have not heard from you in ages! Well, if you care to hear excuses, I have plenty, the greatest of them being Ive been in other dimensions and whatnot, unable to reach you by the usual means. This was the case until eighteen months ago, when I experienced a critical change in my circumstances, and was redeposited on these shores. In the time since, I have been able to think occasionally about how best to describe the intervening years, my years of silence. I do first apologize for the wait, and that done, hasten to finally explain (albeit briefly, quickly, and in very little detail) events following those described in my previous game (referred to herewith as Episode 2).

To begin with, as you may recall from the closing paragraphs of my previous missive, the death of Eli Vance shook us all. The Resistance team was traumatized, unable to be sure how much of our plan might be compromised, and whether it made any sense to go on at all as we had intended. And yet, once Eli had been buried, we found the strength and courage to regroup. It was the strong belief of his brave daughter, the feisty Alex Vance, that we should continue on as her father had wished. We had the Antarctic coordinates, transmitted by Eli's long-time assistant, Dr. Judith Mossman, which we believed to mark the location of the lost luxury liner Borealis. Eli had felt strongly that the Borealis should be destroyed rather than allow it to fall into the hands of the Combine. Others on our team disagreed, believing that the Borealis might hold the secret to the revolutions success. Either way, the arguments were moot until we found the vessel. Therefore, immediately after the service for Dr. Vance, Alex and I boarded a seaplane and set off for the Antarctic; a much larger support team, mainly militia, was to follow by separate transport.

It is still unclear to me exactly what brought down our little aircraft. The following hours spent traversing the frigid waste in a blizzard are also a jumbled blur, ill-remembered and poorly defined. The next thing I clearly recall is our final approach to the coordinates Dr. Mossman has provided, and where we expected to find the Borealis. What we found instead was a complex fortified installation, showing all the hallmarks of sinister Combine technology. It surrounded a large open field of ice. Of the Borealis itself there was no sign...or not at first. But as we stealthily infiltrated the Combine installation, we noticed a recurent, strangely coherent auroral effectas of a vast hologram fading in and out of view. This bizarre phenomenon initially seemed an effect caused by an immense Combine lensing system, Alex and I soon realized that what we were actually seeing was the luxury liner Borealis itself, phasing in and out of existence at the focus of the Combine devices. The aliens had erected their compound to study and seize the ship whenever it materialized. What Dr. Mossman had provided were not coordinates for where the sub was located, but instead for where it was predicted to arrive. The liner was oscillating in and out of our reality, its pulses were gradually steadying, but there was no guarantee it would settle into place for longor at all. We determined that we must put ourselves into position to board it at the instant it became completely physical.

At this point we were briefly detainednot captured by the Combine, as we feared at first, but by minions of our former nemesis, the conniving and duplicitous Wallace Breen. Dr. Breen was not as we had last seen himwhich is to say, he was not dead. At some point, the Combine had saved out an earlier version of his consciousness, and upon his physical demise, they had imprinted the back-up personality into a biological blank resembling an enormous grub. The Breen-grub, despite occupying a position of relative power in the Combine hierarchy, seemed nervous and frightened of me in particular. Wallace did not know how his previous incarnation, the original Dr. Breen, had died. He knew only that I was responsible. Therefore the grub treated us with great caution. Still, he soon confessed (never able to keep quiet for long) that he was herself a prisoner of the Combine. He took no pleasure from her current grotesque existence, and pleaded with us to end his life. Alex believed that a quick death was more than Wallace Breen deserved, but for my part, I felt a modicum of pity and compassion. Out of Alexs sight, I might have done something to hasten the grubs demise before we proceeded.

Not far from where we had been detained by Dr. Breen, we found Judith Mossman being held in a Combine interrogation cell. Things were tense between Judith and Alex, as might be imagined. Alex blamed Judith for her fathers death...news of which, Judith was devastated to hear for the first time. Judith tried to convince Alex that she had been a double agent serving the resistance all along, doing only what Eli had asked of her, even though she knew it meant he risked being seen by her peersby all of usas a traitor. I was convinced; Alex less so. But from a pragmatic point of view, we depended on Dr. Mossman; for along with the Borealis coordinates, she possessed resonance keys which would be necessary to bring the liner fully into our plane of existence.

We skirmished with Combine soldiers protecting a Combine research post, then Dr. Mossman attuned the Borealis to precisely the frequencies needed to bring it into (brief) coherence. In the short time available to us, we scrambled aboard the ship, with an unknown number of Combine agents close behind. The ship cohered for only a short time, and then its oscillations resume. It was too late for our own military support, which arrived and joined the Combine forces in battle just as we rebounded between universes, once again unmoored.

What happened next is even harder to explain. Alex Vance, Dr. Mossman and myself sought control of the shipits power source, its control room, its navigation center. The liners history proved nonlinear. Years before, during the Combine invasion, various members of an earlier science team, working in the hull of a dry-docked liner situated at the Aperture Science Enrichment Center in Lake Michigan, had assembled what they called the Bootstrap Device. If it worked as intended, it would emit a field large enough to surround the ship. This field would then itself travel instantaneously to any chosen destination without having to cover the intervening space. There was no need for entry or exit portals, or any other devices; it was entirely self-contained. Unfortunately, the device had never been tested. As the Combine pushed Earth into the Seven Hour War, the aliens seized control of our most important research facilities. The staff of the Borealis , with no other wish than to keep the ship out of Combine hands, acted in desperation. The switched on the field and flung the Borealis toward the most distant destination they could target: Antarctica. What they did not realize was that the Bootstrap Device travelled in time as well as space. Nor was it limited to one time or one location. The Borealis, and the moment of its activation, were stretched across space and time, between the nearly forgotten Lake Huron of the Seven Hour War and the present day Antarctic; it was pulled taut as an elastic band, vibrating, except where at certain points along its length one could find still points, like the harmonic spots along a vibrating guitar string. One of these harmonics was where we boarded, but the string ran forward and back, in both time and space, and we were soon pulled in every direction ourselves.

Time grew confused. Looking from the bridge, we could see the drydocks of Aperture Science at the moment of teleportation, just as the Combine forces closed in from land, sea and air. At the same time, we could see the Antarctic wastelands, where our friends were fighting to make their way to the protean Borealis; and in addition, glimpses of other worlds, somewhere in the future perhaps, or even in the past. Alex grew convinced we were seeing one of the Combines central staging areas for invading other worldssuch as our own. We meanwhile fought a running battle throughout the ship, pursued by Combine forces. We struggled to understand our stiuation, and to agree on our course of action. Could we alter the course of the Borealis? Should we run it aground in the Antarctic, giving our peers the chance to study it? Should we destroy it with all hands aboard, our own included? It was impossible to hold a coherent thought, given the baffling and paradoxical timeloops, which passed through the ship like bubbles. I felt I was going mad, that we all were, confronting myriad versions of ourselves, in that ship that was half ghost-ship, half nightmare funhouse."	neg

"50 years from now:

Here at Bethesdaland we have decided to shake things up again!

-We used to make games that allowed players to lose themselves in the myriad of choices as a result of our thoughtfully-crafted gameplay mechanics.

-Then we decided to pay modders for their work to make our games more suitable for years of fun at the expense of the players. It set a new course for the company and we've cooked up something extra spicy for everyone this time...

-We are officially--and proudly--announcing that Bethesda now offers the unprecedented opportunity for players to **make their own games!** Of course, we couldn't have done this without the help of our old friends, Electronic Arts. With the purchase of *TES VII: Skyrim 3::Legendary Ultimate Dragonborn Reborn Online Edition* and a Season Pass from EA, our customers can take immersion and creativity to a whole new level! Here's what I mean:

-Record voice for character dialogue (and write scripts!)

-Create **custom** character, item, and environment models and textures!

-We can't code physics worth a god damn so we'll just leave that up to you. Also bug fixes and frame-stutters and the trademark ""Bethesda crashes.""

"I have a story about this! In high school, I had a friend who was too into sidescrolling fighting games like Street Fighter.  (When you start counting the frames it takes to complete a move, you know you've gone too far.) He got sick of the fact that nobody could get close to beating him, so he low key trained me and another friend of his.  The other friend didn't really keep up (he lived far away,) so I just kept getting better and better.  I never surpassed the one friend, but found I was just good enough to make casual play boring.  Online matches are a joke because you've either achieved God level or you're noob.

Because I don't have a Switch and probably never will get the chance, the first time I touched Smash Ultimate while at a friend's B-Day party, I got to feel the noob feeling again. Just playing a fighting game for the sake of playing and knowing very little about the fighters. Having fun in my own way.  He had the whole roster unlocked so I insisted on choosing random every time, getting to try the new characters.

Then he told me to get serious, I chose Lucas, proceeded to own everyone, and they told me to stop being serious."	pos

I was the youngest in my group, and another kid brought a magazine that had an ad for the first Tomb Raider game in it. Myself, this kid, and three other boys were in the back seats on the way to the trip, and these kids were ogling over the ad, trying to sound cool by making the kind of comments that they probably heard guys on TV say without totally understanding it. I just sank into my seat feeling uncomfortable about what I perceived to be immature and disrespectful behavior. My dad was driving and overheard what was going on in the back, so he pulled over, demanding to see the magazine that the kids were passing around, probably expecting the worst. When he saw the ad he just laughed, shook his head, handed the magazine back to one of the other kids and was like, You guys are into babes? And you like em tough, huh? I can respect that. We should get you this game when we get home, son.

In that one moment I became the envy of every kid in the van, but was way too embarrassed about my dad thinking I was into babes to enjoy the attention at all lol.

"This is of course the abridged scene.

In reality, the true story began 60 years ago when a nanomachine enhanced seadragon was impregnated by a CIA experimental drone. The result was the birth of Hideo Kojima, and his twin brother, Haudio Kojima.

You see, back in the second world war, a clandestine group of rogue agents planned to take over the United States government through the use of psychedelic drugs. This would eventually lead to the MK Ultra program. However, to distribute their experimental drugs, a new form of interactive entertainment would be required. Using an Enigma machine mounted onto a walking dinosaur for added mobility, this group known as Konami created the prototype video entertainment system, the Metal Game Gear.

To act as the face of the program, Konami gene spliced the DNA of a grizzled 1980s action hero and an androgynous white haired edge lord, separating all the positive qualities into Hideo and the negative qualities into Haudio, or as he would later come to be known, Raiden.

Several million of pages worth of dialogue later, the experiment was a success, and Hideo was born."	pos

The PlayStation exclusives are inarguably superior and far outnumber the Xbox. Yup, theres absolutely overlap for majority of games but thats where I think youre seeing Sony standing firm. Were 2 years tops away from the next console release, meaning everyone is going to have a pretty big choice to make on a big purchase decision for the foreseeable future. Since ps4 outsold Xbox at a pace that I last saw was 2-1 theyd like to not only keep that dominate market share but also capture more console players from Microsoft that no longer want to miss out on god of war, last of us, horizon zero dawn, uncharted etc etc. If you hold your ground now and dont allow cross play, then its all about micro social influence. 

If a circle of friends who have been predominantly Xbox players started losing friends to PlayStation because of the titles (which the numbers reflect is completely plausible) then all Sony has to do is toe the line until the new system launch and hope that the more influential gamers in those circles jump ship from ms to them. Players that would otherwise have remained Xbox at this point now have to consider moving too even if they have NO INTENTION of playing the PlayStation exclusives because the mp games they play with their friends dont allow for cross platform.  If Sony cracks to pressure to allow x-play then those people will just stay Xbox. Simple business.

Social influence, peer pressure, the fear of choosing the loser in the console war...theres a pretty long list of things that are going to influence consumer decision when it comes to the success of the next phase of the console war - as always. 

But this campaign has new fronts which I also think bode well for Sony. Streaming.  Streaming was still not exactly a major cultural phenomenon at the launch of these current systems. They were smart enough to realize the trend was real - kudos to them - but its blown up in the last year or so thanks to the proliferation of games like fortnite. (Love it or hate it)

Gamers are going to be influenced by the content creators they watch, want to play with, and/or aspire to be. If these gamers are considering trying to emulate those streamers then theyve obviously seen that the PlayStation gives them a hell of a lot more options as far as titles go. 

I recently became an EA gamechanger and have been in talks with a major sponsor for the last month. Im still what I would never call anything more than a small streamer. My channel just past 6 months old. But Ive grown a solid community in that time and I can tell you first hand that my content has led to at least 5 people buying PlayStations over their current Xbox because they were introduced to games they had ignored previously because they were unavailable to them on Xbox. Additionally, since I focus a lot on games that are indeed available on both systems - the fact that Xbox owners cannot play with me has already led to numerous community members stating that theyll buy whatever console I go with when the time comes. Again, Im a small fry and still adjusting to things like the above - but you cannot underestimate how much of a factor these kinds of variables will play and I think Sony is not ignorant of that either if some random dude on Reddit can figure it out. 

It doesnt help Sony in any way to allow cross platform. We as gamers might want it. Xbox obviously would want it since theyre now getting dominated in sales, but dont forget they said no when they were king last gen - sorry Xbox fanboys trying to paint Sony as evil. Ms blamed it on security, which was resolved. Sony says its technologically impossible, but I dont even know if that wasnt intentional at this point. I just dont see it ever happening. The leader gains nothing from the runner-up here, where the runner up is granted a life vest because no consumer suffers from making the wrong choice early when it comes to multi-platform games. 

As a PlayStation owner I dont want cross platform. It wouldnt enhance my life at all. So if I were asked my vote would be no. I have never heard another PlayStation friend say I wish cross platform was a thing.  Its just never happened. The only complaining I heard was from Xbox owners and the only reason theyve wanted it falls on the fact that they stayed with a system that clearly had so little to offer when these two launched. That was entirely fanboy/loyalty based if you objectively stand back and look at what we even knew when the systems launched. You made a bad call. Hopefully you dont repeat it - and thats saying that maybe Xbox will be superior next time - who knows? I sure as hell havent yet decided until everything is laid out in front of me over the next year or so. 

TL;DR. Cross play will never happen between Sony and Xbox. The king will always find a way to say it cant work. It makes no sense that the leader saves the loser. Make better decisions based on research and exclusive deals. It wont happen. Period. "	pos
"Fun story. When I was waiting for Cyrberpunk to come out after I preordered it, my countdown started with 12 hours of advantage, resulting in the game looking playable half a day before the actual release. As you can guess, it wasnt, and it stuck the PlayStation in a loop of going in the game and sending me back to the timer, which had already reached zero. Of course turning the console off solved the problem, but I guess that game was buggy from even before the beginning."	pos

If Gen Alpha has issues (and undoubtably they will), it will be due to their young age and the problems created when they were young, and the issues made by the people that came before them (so... their parents!). Ive never in my life understood slang, being a rather asocial person, so Gen Alpha slang is just as baffling as Gen Z slang was. 

Breaking the cycle is not a generational thing, its a personal thing. I see mellenials and Gen Xs  and Boomers who are kind and compassionate towards younger people, and I see people in my own generation that are bigots and morons. Its a personal attitude of understanding.

I had to make a post in august because followers contacted my family (somehow got their number?) to make sure I was okay. While I appreciate the sentiment, that was a huge reason why I had to leave. Too much parasocial relationships and constantly thinking about how you can get more interaction/what to post etc. life is way too short for that. Now its been so long that my friends started sending me pics and videos in texts because they know I wont see their story. They dont send me every single picture they post. Just the worthy ones.

This from the same people who clapped like seals at the prospect of Mandatory Genetic Vaccines.  You won't eat the corn because it MIGHT be genetically modified, but we all better genetically modify ourselves or else not be able to work.    


But, to be fair, you did accidentally touch on a point. Don't ever let them tell you you're ""earning more"" because you're not.  You might be earning more dollars, but the value of those individual dollars has been tanked, because they keep creating more out of thin air.  This is the ONLY source of inflation, and you and everyone else should reject their gaslighting when they blame you for it, like you have a money printer in your attic.    


And when they're causing record inflation, it's literally an assault on your savings.  So, economically, the only way to actually hedge against them devaluing the currency is to buy things of value that have a better chance of retaining their value, if not monetarily, than in life enrichment.  There's no point in saving if they're just going to destroy the dollars you've saved."	pos

"Just because the generation doesnt agree, doesnt mean they are right.

Middle class income in 2023 is around $38k-$115k before considering regional cost of living. (Obviously LA or NYC or Miami would be higher).

From 2017-2021 I supported my wife (student) and myself on a salary of $39k. We rented a 2 bed, 2 bath house with 0.5 acre fenced yard. This was inside a city with a population around 200,000. We were comfortable, we ate out, we had plenty of streaming services. HOWEVER, I didnt buy designer everything, I waited maybe 1-2 years to upgrade phones (didnt hit the new releases), we drove used but functional vehicles, and we were able to save a little money.

I saw someone on here saying if you are young, make $74k and dont have money saved... WHOA let me stop you right there. If you make $74k a year and arent able to save money then the issue isnt cost of living... its your lifestyle.

I now own a 3 bedroom house, 6acres, and horses. I make about $130k and wife is currently staying home with our child (our choice). Im able to put back several thousand a month in savings after paying all our bills (we are fast tracking our mortgage and student loans).

The cost of living in Miami FL, which is like the 4th most expensive in the entire country is about $58,000 a year for 1 person. So, if you made $74k then you should be living pretty damn comfortably. If you arent, then you gotta get some shit together. Even a family of 4 is still only about $93k, so if both spouses work youre gucci."	pos

"Well yah, but complaining about things and forcing change is why we have the good things we have. You dont get rights by simply rolling over and taking whatever the people in power give you.

I think people also forget that the good life in America is only available to a few. 

We have plenty of places with zero infrastructure, where its hard to get clean water, where there are no schools or doctors in a reasonable distance,  where there are straight up food deserts and people are starving due to poverty. There are people in cities living 3 - 5+ to a one bedroom apartment and people who are trapped in company housing or wage slave situations. There are people dying to easily treatable and preventable illnesses because they cant pay 300 a month in healthcare, or pay for the 500+ dollar uninsured doctor visit, or the 200 dollar a vial insulin, or whatever medication theyre on, so they just die. 

I mean hell, I knew people that had family die in Texas during the freeze because the power grid went down. 

These arent even extreme poverty situations, just the choice is often rent vs food vs utilities vs healthcare and those choices sometimes mean your life. 

As the saying goes, America is 3rd world country in a Gucci belt. 

its definitely not as bad as other places, and intense poverty here is still better than poverty elsewhere in some cases. But, just because its worse in other places doesnt mean we stop making it better, here. 

That said, there are plenty of privileged Americans that are delusional and think places like China, Japan or Korea are ultra progressive, or that every European country is Amsterdam, because Americans have a horrible habit of fetishizing other places/people/cultures and turning them into fantasy playgrounds in their heads."	neg

*has running, clean water both hot and cold on demand in an air-conditioned home with laws dictating safety regulations in the building to ensure it doesnt fall on them or choke them with a gas leak overnight, has exorbitantly expensive, but generally high quality healthcare if said person has insurance, which 91% of Americans have, a government that is solidly not being swayed by literal street gangs and drug cartels, will have a higher wage in a professional occupation than most of the world, though HCOL is an issue (but its a worldwide issue atm), and a 100% full-on bold-faced guarantee that their country will never be war-torn the way many ACTUAL third world countries are, based on geography alone and negating unquestionable military power.* 

People lose their fucking minds over the 2016 election most likely being fraudulent (as well as the 2000 election that was absolutely fraudulent but brushed under the rug), and theyre well within their right to be concerned and call it out as the crime that it is, but thats also every single election in a still-developing country. Americans acting like America is literal hell have no idea how corrupt a government can actually be. Can you IMAGINE trying to bribe a cop in NYC?

I think the real definition of third world is wildly different from the chronically online one considering that A. The US is not even CLOSE to a still-developing country in terms of quality of life, infrastructure, and economic mobility, and B. First world and third world are terms derived from the Cold War, in which the US and US-aligned nations were considered part of the first world, Soviet and soviet-aligned nations were the second world with third world being the nations (usually underdeveloped and in the global south) that either chose not to or didnt have the money to stay involved in the conflict.

The two that bother me the most are the ones on each of my shoulders. Both cause by bacne gone wrong. They get so itchy and uncomfortable and so red. It's always when I least it expect it does someone point it out. But I have others on other parts of my body.

"In the 90s I worked at a fine dining restaurant. A famous wrestler (FW) comes in with his date. You can tell, he's not a nice guy. The busboy comes over to fill their water glasses and some condensation from the pitcher drips on his arm. He stands up, takes the pitcher and dumps it on the busboy's head. The manager approaches and FW goes full bam bam on him. Screaming and yelling and physically posturing. So, the manager says 'it's time to go.' Instead FW bear hugs him and throws him into a booth. It was like a medieval call to arms and the entire cooking staff comes out to defend the manager. FW had no clue, but the head chef is and ex-NFL lineman and the pantry cook is an ex-heavy weight boxer. When FW made a move towards the chef, the boxer squared off and sent FW tumbling. He got up for some more and was met with a barrage of fists. After getting up a second time, he backs down, but is still running his mouth. Now the police are coming through the dining room just in time to hear FW threaten to get his gun out of the car. So, while escorting FW outside the GF decides it's a good idea to jump on the back of the arresting officer, pulling his hair. A second officer grabbed her by the hair and belt and face first body slams her on the hood of the police car. She's out cold, and FW is still making threats. So, after getting both of them in cuffs, the officers proceed to search FW's car. He's yelling that he was only bluffing, but, the cops have probable cause. They start by breaking the MBenz S class' window to get in, then proceed to literally tear the interior to shreds. No gun. It was funny that one officer says he'll get the key from FW but the other says don't bother and breaks the window."	neg
"I see people fighting over how much is proper amount of water to cook rice. 

As a Thai from my experiece it depends on type of rice. Some rice need more water, some need less to cook properly. So just experiment and adjust.

"Ive been there for work. It was fun but you do have to slum it a bit. No hot water or air con in the one hotel or the guest house nearby. All the food is canned apart from fish (theres no space, soil or rain to grow anything) . The hotel doesnt have a menu. It has the one fish and canned veg meal its doing today.

The main island where you stay (Funafuti) isnt some kind of tropical paradise. Every inch is built up with ramshackle huts. Easy to take a boat to somewhere thats all beach and palms though. Internet at the time (maybe 12 years ago) was via one satellite dish for the island so was slower than dial up but with a lot more down time and latency. That might have improved now with better internet satellite tech.

The reason they use the runway as a park is that it and the dump are the only open spaces on the island. You see that neck of land he pointed out? I reckon thats just outside the dump.

When the plane is landing the fire engine chases all the stray dogs off the runway. It often takes a couple of passes to land as the dogs come back and have to be chased off again. People always make out their primary industry is the .tv domain. It isnt. its charity from China, Japan, New Zealand and Australia.

The island ran out of beer while I was there. Everything comes in on the two planes from Fiji a week or the one boat a fortnight so shortages happen often. I saw a looooot of disposable nappies on that plane.

The people were fantastically friendly and I had some good evenings getting pissed with them on their coconut wine stuff. There isnt much else to do there except take a boat out to go fishing or land on an island, have a swim, and get a coconut and maybe cook some fish. I did attend an island event of some kind at the hotel with dancing etc. Dont remember much except I was there early so had a better seat than the Prime Minister.

"My Grandmother was Maltese.  She was a proper little Mediterranean Granny. She knew how her mother cooked and how her mother cooked before her.

Shame none of them looked up the definition of a boiled egg or toast. Seriously, how can you get to 50, cook a full breakfast every morning AND NOT be able to time an egg? Toast should not be blue. A dark golden brown with butter is ideal, but never should it be a drawing implement. Black with blue crusts means that, beyond burnt, this fucking toast was on FIRE!

Any veg was chopped, boiled with a fistful of salt for an hour until grey and mushy and tasteless. Meat was boiled until leather or roasted until it could have been thick toast.

I learned from a young age not to complain, not to try to pass it to the dog... just move every thing into a napkin and offer to do the dishes like a good little boy... ditching the food in the bin as I went.

My mother was just as bad. By 11 I was making my own food just so I didn't get poisoned.

My mother figured time and temperature were interchangeable.  If the frozen lasagne said gas mark 5 for 30 minutes then 15 minutes at gas 8 would work, right?

I'm not a billionaire, I said it too. Because it's true. ""Why should we have to forgo things that make us happy?"" because you want to save money. If you don't, don't. ""But I can't because I make minimum wage!"" cool, I didn't ask. Get a better job. ""But not everyone can..."" Yes they can. You wanna be a defeatist about your future that's all you dude. Even fast food workers can apply at retirement homes to cook and make an extra 5 bucks an hour doing easier work. 

Too much of this just strikes me as taking the valid problem of greedy billionaires and using it to blame all of your issues on, and they're not going away dude. Taxing them won't put more money in your pocket, the government will eat that like they do the rest of the taxes. You're not gonna legislate people into not being greedy. Figure it out.

"I used to know a horribly wealthy and entitled man, my boyfriend at the time was renting a room in his house. They had a boys night every week, and a guy with far less money used to join a couple of them while they watched sports and drank beer. Nice guy, family man with two nice kids. Almost every time he would prepare 5 kilos of meat, marinate it overnight, and bring a deep fryer and oil and cook for the bastards in his traditional style. They all loved it, it was delicious every time. They never helped him cook or prep or clean, sometimes they paid for the meat. One year for his birthday they bought him a deep fryer so he didnt have to keep bringing his to sports night. He was grateful, somehow. He could come to sports night, but was excluded from all kinds of other stuff. And was made to know he was worth less. Theyd known this guy twenty odd years when he killed himself. If only hed had some friends."	pos

Edit: Calm down people we were enjoying the moment, we weren't trying to rush there. I'll concede it was probably more of a 7-10min walk not a 15min.

"As soon as I read the caption I knew I was gonna riot if he didn't make his steak well done. Black people are terrified of meat that isn't brown.

A few years ago my white friend made steaks for his birthday dinner and served mine to me in a fashion that I can only describe as ""personally motivated"". I was the only black guy at the function, might I add. 

He said nothing to me as he cut my steak open and revealed the medium center. I looked at him. He looked at me. I looked at him looking at me. Then he said ""Try it."" I asked him ""You're trying to kill me?"" and he responds ""You're my only black friend. That would look really bad on my part."" to which I replied ""Fair enough."" and I took a *very* skeptical bite. By this point everyone has realized this is new for me and they're waiting intently for my reaction.

Well long story short, that shit S-L-A-P-P-E-D. I'll never have another well done steak. I've always thought I hated steak but I don't. I just don't like steak the way most black people cook them. Also I've tried putting my family and gf on but they just keep telling me I'm crazy and I'm gonna get sick.. LMAO. Your loss"	neg

"Enchiladas are made from corn tortillas, dipped into salsa and cooked on a pan or oven. They are served rolled up as tacos, filled with chicken, some other meat or cheese. You can add onion, tomato, cream and shredded cheese on top as preffered. You eat it with knife and fork by cutting small pieces

Chilaquiles are tortilla *chips* that are fried or oven cooked beforehand and thrown into salsa which softens them. You add the same things as enchiladas, but eat them more like a cereal or similar

Flautas are deep fried tacos but with a bigger tortilla. They can be filled with barbacoa (salted pulled meat), chicken, cheese, beans, mashed potato and some more. You bathe them in salsa (different one, much thinner than the enchilada/chilaquiles one because it's not boiled), also cream and cheese. You eat them by hand just like tacos

Sope are like a taco, but the ""tortilla"" is made from a thick mixture of flour and dough, always fried and shaped into a circle with tapered edges. This is because almost always the circle is covered in mashed beans and the edges keep them from spilling over. This is covered by toppings such as chicken, barbacoa, lettuce, etc. and salsa. Eaten by hand, holding it from the bottom and biting from the outside in.

Tostadas are the same as sopes, but use a hard tortilla that's baked so as to harden.

So the ingredients are almost the same (as with any other regional couisine) but prepared and used in many different ways"	pos

"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."	neg

"#You will need

Tomatoes, tomato paste, a dry wine, olive oil, onions, garlic, pepperoncino, salt, pepper, and basil.

#Recipe

Start off by dicing your onion, garlic, and pepperoncino. Then move onto the tomatoes. I recommend using canned whole san marzanos tomatoes, but if you feel like being extra you can also blanche some fresh tomatoes if you want. You can also use pre crushed canned tomatoes. You can also crush your tomatoes by hand or use a food processor. 

After that, preheat a pan on high for a minute or two and then coat the bottom in your olive oil. Add in the onions and pepperoncino first in order to sweat them for a bit. They will not need long to cook, just wait for the onions to become translucent a bit. After this, add in the garlic and cook until aromatic. Don't brown the garlic or it will become very bitter.

Once aromatic, add in about an ounce or two of tomato paste and fry it for a bit. Frying the tomato paste will add more flavor to the sauce and just make it taste better. Mix it around with the onions, garlic, and pepper.

After the tomato paste has fried for a bit, add in your wine of choice. Ensure it is a dry wine. If you add in a white wine, it will add a certain sweetness and acidity to the sauce. If you add in a red wine, it will add in a richer, almost meaty flavor to the sauce. Mix around until the alcohol smell has burned off and the tomato paste had mixed in with the wine.

Now, drop the heat to a medium-low and add in the tomatoes, basil, salt, and pepper. Allow to simmer and make sure you taste the sauce to get it to where you want. The simmering should take around 20 minutes or so, though really this depends on how thick you want it. 

After done, you have your sauce and it is so much better than what you will get at a store in a jar. You can use this sauce for pasta, muscles and marinara, or chicken parm."	pos
"Sauce I cant give you but Im true Reddit bullshit fashion, here is a pizza recipie, specifically naan bread pizza

**how to cook naan bread pizza**

You will need

\-naan bread -pizza sauce -mozzarella cheese -pepperoni -optional toppings of your choice, its **your** pizza after all.

*how to assemble it* Grab a spoon and the pizza sauce, make a big drop of pizza sauce about 2/3 the size of your fist, spread with the spoon, then grab the mozzarella cheese and spread liberally (or conservatively if you so choose). Then place the pepperoni and other toppings however you so choose and then, I like to sprinkle some salad herbs on top just because

*the cooking*

Preheat your oven to 425 Fahrenheit and pop the pizza in. Wait 4-6 mins and take it out for a pizza that is cooked enough and still has that nice naan bread feel, 6-8 minutes for a little crispier, and anything over that is really crispy.

In the end it should look like this

"It's bought they've already achieved profitability through pre order and season pass. They literally don't care anymore they are on to bf3 by now I'd say


The only way to win is not play. Buying the game and being disappointed is built into their model now 

Get a franchise put as little money in as possible for the most profit back and milk it till it's not profitable. Kill the studio and go find another 


Like people like you that buy ea games then complain after but go buy the  next ea game are the problem. Preorders ruined the gaming landscape 


EDIT: In relation to me saying season pass 

whatever they charged 80 quid for this time on preorder extra loot boxes or guns or whatever. Same idea. Like they didnt charge extra for the season pass last time because it cost ea more to do the dlcs, that was already paid for and being done, they just needed something to sell the 80 quid preorder version

"What reason is there even to preorder these days? A bit of extra content? IMO That's not worth potentially wasting $60 if the game turns out to be shit. The only reason we preordered back in the day was because supply was often < demand, and games didn't have a reputation for being completely broken at launch. With digital downloads, there's no chance of not getting a copy.

Edit: Preloading is also not a sufficient reason to preorder a game. If you're too impatient to wait for a download, you earned wasting your money on a shit game. Just wait for the reviews, it's not hard.

Edit 2: Alright, I'll accept accessing a beta as a legitimate reason to preorder. As you get to sample the product, and decide if you want to spend your money or cancel the preorder. Although a beta will not paint the entire picture. I still think anything other than purchasing after you've seen reviews is just dumb."	neg

Edit: I'm going to make a couple quick edits rather than reply to repetitious comments. (When I saw that I had 200+ notifications I was wondering who I pissed off)

* For those saying I don't understand economics and it's ""supply and demand,"" I'm suggesting that we should modify the demand.
* For those saying it's rich people or people who can afford it, do you honestly think the majority of these buyers fit in this category? 
* For those saying that they can just return them to Walmart and wouldn't lose money... you probably have a point. But it's still an inconvenience.
* For those saying I'm salty or want this for selfish reasons, I'm the dude in this comic [https://xkcd.com/606/](https://xkcd.com/606/) and the last system I bought at launch was the N64. And I'll be honest, it was because I was so hyped from that [VHS they sent to my house.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxUmSyZ7Ylo)"	neg

"Tbh I think Minecraft art like this is extremely under appreciated. It takes so much time, effort, and in many cases planning, to achieve something like this. You have to know how each blocks color and texture looks from far away. You have to know how to arrange blocks in a specific way to look curved from far away, and different angles of curves are made different ways. It may only be sitting at a computer and clacking away at a mouse and keyboard, but that shouldnt automatically rule it out as a form of art. It takes as much practice and passion as painting, sculpting, songwriting, etc. I do works similar to this all the time, but more building-esque rather than sculptures, but Im still constantly learning new things about what I think looks good, how to make good curves, spacing, natural vs artificial, and much, much more, just like with any other artistic craft.

"As someone whos done some side work for extra money running chainsaws, my biggest complaints from this video (constructive criticism, its a great start.)

Needs to cut slower. To cut a piece of wood like that, at that speed, would take a small car engine to do. It would probably take a solid 30 seconds with a good Stihl to make that first cut.

No kickback: when you touch the end of the blade to something, it throws the blade up in the air. The closer to the end of the blade, the more kickback.

It also pulls you forward when you cut, but not sure how you could replicate that in VR so that can slide.

Also, chainsaws vibrate, but not that much. Theyre pretty easy to hold very steady, the vibration only hurts your hands after a while of doing it, you cant actually see the saw vibrating just looking at it."	pos

So I was playing silent hill 4 when I was about 14-15 in my room upstairs and I swear to you its a true story. 

I was at the part in the game where there were pentagrams everywhere in the water prison and I was running from Walter. I was going through a goth metal phase and I had a bunch of posters on my walls of dragons, cradle of filth, and one of death taking the souls out of a young woman. 

Anyways, as I was playing I got super dizzy and set down the controllerstarted filling SUPER nauseous and the battery operated strobe light I had started slowing flashing and then speeding up super fast and then just abruptly stopped and broke. Right after that the poster of death on my wall fell off of every tack and my lights in my room and hallway went off. This all happened in a matter of 20 seconds. 

I never ran so fast down the stairs in my life and I slept on the couch for weeks and made my mom go and tear down all of those posters. I stopped listening to black metal after that and havent touched a silent hill game until recently.

I asked you and a colleague if there was much to do right away for a level 45, and rather than wonder, rightly so, why Id let myself get dragged to a launch event, you suggested I join the wave of brand new people making newly available alliance Shamans so I wouldn't be left behind.

Years later, you mentioned in some podcast about blasting the burning crusade theme over the store speakers, and it clicked that Id been listening to your content for years without realising we'd ever met.

You changed this industry in so many positive ways, but on a personal level, that one small bit of advice you gave me caused me to meet a group of people who undoubtedly became my closest friends, more than a decade on, hell, I even work alongside some of the people I met through that leveling group.

"And so, it begins.

Dark were the skies, and chill was the wind as the land was covered in a veil of malice.
Across the hill did ride a dread army of the night; cloaked in mist and fog, prepared to rain down death and destruction upon the land.

And the people cried out for a savior, a noble soul to save them from their impending demise!
Just when it seemed all was lost, in strode a mighty hero clad in shimmering metal from head to toe.

Wielding a terrible broadsword, he did cleave his foes in twain, smashing their axe asunder with a righteous fury!

And when the day was done, and the enemy strewn across the field in pieces, the people did turn to the warrior and say:
""We shall name this day in your honor; speak unto us your wisdom.""
Slowly, the warrior did turn to face the assembled crowd. Lifting his sword on high, he said but one word that day...

**EPIC**

Gonna miss ya, TB."	neg
"So my father has been dying from cancer for the past few years. We used to game together but when he couldn't do that anymore he wanted to watch streamers and let's plays. He barely had enough energy for that but he loved our gaming time together so much that he felt it would do and it totally did. TB was one of our favorites and I feel like my dad forgot about his own problems when he felt the sorrow of this news.

He doesn't have a lot of time left, just a couple months best case, but thank you TB. Thank you for helping me and pops have fun together in yet another of the many ways gaming can be experienced nowadays. Ill cherish the memories with my dad and watching your videos was a part of that."	pos

EDIT: This is from the [guy who made the calculations](http://www.swtorstrategies.com/2017/11/it-will-take-4528-hours-of-gameplay-or-2100-to-unlock-all-base-game-content.html):

>Im assuming that all cards are already possessed, are at level 3, and that the player has 0 credits and crafting parts left over. Im also assuming that all one time rewards (challenges and level rewards) were used while getting the cards to level 3, so they are not factored in.

Basically, 4528 hours (or $2100) is JUST for getting the cards from level 3 to level 4.

>This estimate ignores the time required to get all cards to level 3, the time required to unlock all heroes, and daily crates.

Â 

EDIT 2: The price would be even higher if he didn't account for duplicates. Duplicates result in extra credits, the extra credits you'd get from hero crates amount to about 27% the cost of a hero crate, so he adjusted the price (in crystals) by 27%."	pos

Since you need a high-end PC to run Battlefront II in the first place, and assuming you own no consoles, we just have to add the prices of those. Note that that's the reason SNES games all cost 0 here.

Xbox 360	| 100	|

With 19 hours and 5 bucks to spare, we can probably add another cool indie or retro game to our list.  
In short...

**You can legally buy most of the best games ever made, as well as the systems needed to play them, with the same amount you'd need to just unlock stuff that should be accessible from the start. AND you have the time to not just beat them all, but do EVERYTHING in them in the time it'd take you to otherwise grind for all of that.**

----

Yes I'm aware you need EITHER 4528 hours *or* $2100 to unlock everything, not both. I just thought both were very interesting factors to calculate: how much time is 4528 hours really, when it comes to gaming, and how much money it is, too. 

Also, a few things about the method used.  
I tried to include the most important, most critically acclaimed games, above all. Of course I had to choose which ones to leave out, so there's some of my opinion in there, too. Feel free to swap whatever game or system you want, to make your own list, if you feel like it. 

Overall I tried to include a bit of everything, from many different series and genres (even ones I don't like as much). I know it's missing a lot of sports and music based games especially, I just don't know these well enough, personally.

Really quick, you'll also notice HowLongToBeat times are rounded down, I didn't want to bother with half hours. I also don't agree with all of them necessarily, but I wanted a more objective place to take these times from. It's not like I've beaten all the games in this list 100% myself, anyway.

---

As for the prices...  
For consoles and games still sold in stores, I went with the current, official retail price. Same for downloadable games, I used the Playstation and Xbox store websites to check that.

For consoles and games not sold anywhere anymore, I went to amazon, and went with the average price of used copies. That's why some rarer games (Melee for example) cost more than others.

I also went with the best versions of each game, when possible. So HD collections and remasters, instead of resorting to finding a used copy of the game on Amazon (which would've been cheaper). Made it a bit more challenging not to go over $2100."	pos

Then, enter September 2013. My 16th birthday was earlier in the month, and on the 17th, my dad picked me up from school and drove me to the local Gamestop. He had secretly pre-ordered it for me, as my birthday present. I was so excited. We walked into the store, and the clerk gave the spiel about ""this game is incredibly graphic, you may as well be buying him an HD porno"" and ""be sure to install it to the hard drive, Rockstar are warning people about that"".

â

We'd had our washing machine flood our apartment a few days prior, so we were staying at a hotel with a TV much nicer than the one we had at home. We got to the room, i booted the game up and...i couldn't believe it. It was better than i hoped. The game looked so real, the driving was so fun, and it was the best birthday present ever.

â

Fast forward to 2017, i got my first job and bought a 4k tv and an XBONE S. GTA V was the first game i purchased next gen, because i was excited for the first person view, the new content, all of it. I didn't regret it until they made Online a grind.

â

You guys know by now how much i love this game, and what it's meant to me over the years. And so you know i mean it when i say IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON.

â

GTA V is dead. It's been 7 years. GTA V has given me countless hours of enjoyment, probably in the thousands at this point. But there's nothing new, nothing attention grabbing, nothing to make me buy it again. The graphics aren't as impressive as newer games, the story is stale after beating it so many times, and Online was ruined by microtransactions and the ridiculous vehicles. GTA V holds no appeal to anyone who's not a troll or younger than the age of 18 anymore.

â

I want NEW. Not recycled. I want to buy a new game, tear off the plastic cling wrap, put it in my console's disk drive and experience what i experienced 7 years ago again. 

â

We're not just the money you return to your shareholders, Rockstar. We're more than that. We're your consumers, your fans. We're what bought GTA 3, VC, SA, IV, and V. We're what made you what you are today, and instead of rewarding us, you're taking advantage of us. It's a really sickening thing to see, and as one of your former biggest fans, i truly hope you fix yourselves soon.

Until then, you will get not one cent out of my pocket."	pos
I bet the player dated someone *named* Malenia (or similar) and it ended *badly*.	neg
I bet From makes him a character or some other homage to him in a future game.	neg
"This reminds me of this Japanese YouTuber (streamed the game) I watched, who played a full intelligence build, wore nothing but the head gear since around the halfway point in the game, and he finished game in the probably one of the most epic ways  >!a double KO with the Elden Beast!<. He beat Malenia with the same build too. It did take him many many tries though.

Iirc the build was 99 Intelligence, 50 Mind (cause flask recovery couldnt keep up when he tried 70), just enough Dexterity and Strength to hold different staffs, and the rest into Endurance, with no investment in Vigor (it was just 9 at the end). Idk the name of the weapons cause I dont play the game and I only watched this guy play, but he mained 3 staves: main one is the kind that consumes extra FP to deal more damage (a little search tells me its Lusats staff), and the other 2 were gravity boost and full moon, so I guess its pretty standard maxed-out mage?

The guy just dual wields staffs in fights, yells Kamehameha or Make up (reference to Sailor Moon, and at one point gave up on becoming Sailor Moon and aimed to be Sailor Stone, cause Rock Sling is pretty OP), and sometimes get to enjoy cheesing bosses cause the AI decided to target his summons. He usually uses the 2 skeleton summon too, low damage, but revival makes em really good as bait."	pos
"To everyone saying the OP didn't own the IP begin with, that's not the point. The point is that MS are paying top dollar to an ad firm that get their concepts from random creatives on Reddit - I.e. some talentless designer ripped off someone else's creativity, and earned money off it. It's not a legal problem, it's a moral one - and one OP has every right to be annoyed about.

I doubt MS or the ad company will acknowledge this tbh as that would mean admitting they stole the idea. Maybe OP will get a free Xbox on the quiet though. OP should definitely put this in their port no matter what though: ""came up with a design copied by Microsoft"" lol

Edit: The funniest thing about this to me is that I actually think OP's design is better - the perspective makes the concept clearer. So they stole it, AND made it worse XD"	pos

Does it have science based dragons?	neg
"Ive got a few suggestions just based on what Im seeing right now to make the game even better (although you mightve already considered these): 
- Add different creatures that Impact the type of buildings you can create, or resources that you can harvest 
- Weather (fairly simple explanation)
- Ability to find other monster or find other monster villages that you can trade with, attack, or possibly defend against. 
- Adding a time oriented drop down ladder/ monster landing mechanic where villagers can harvest materials from the environment they are currently above. 
- Monster breeding: ability to hatch eggs that can spawn smaller monsters than be used in combat or used to expand your island
- Health impacts on your monster: monster can get sick and villagers must have the right protective gear to dive into the monsters mouth to treat its illness
- More temperamental ideas for the monster: if trust rating drops with monster, volcanoes or other weather hazards can spawn on island 

Just a few ideas! Looks great so far and wish you the best of luck!"	pos

"I had a cat named Tony. An animal I had the same exact bond with as you did with this one. He would sit in my lap as I gamed on my computer for a decade and a half.

Somewhere along the line I got into some bad business, and had to move and because of personal issues within my life, left him at my parents house for a year here, or a couple months there. But every time Id visit hed rush up to me and Id sit outside with him for hours just hanging out and petting him. 

After I got my shit straightened out and settled back down my parents told me he was getting very old, and lost a tooth. We thought he was gonna go soon and they thought I should be the one to care for him in these last moments. Without a second thought I dropped everything and brought him to my house. (Something I was going to do regardless of his age/health.)  I got everything set up for him and fed him soft food everyday, gave him the usual attention, and of course the space every cat also needs. 

He lived on for another 3 or 4 fantastic years. I was older now and worked full time, but every weekend Id sit down to game for a bit on my computer, and just like good ol times hed run over and hop in my lap and just....BE there until I got up. He was 16 when he passed of natural causes, no pain, no agony, just a really freaking old cat. I keep his collar on my wall and jiggle his little ID tag whenever Im feeling down to remind of what it used to sound like when he would run up to me all excitedly when we I got home. 

I still miss him following me around everywhere. I miss how he would HOWL out the window with excitement that dad was home from work. But most of all, I miss the calm...pure...and peaceful lap sits. Just me, and my boy. Chillin. Gamin.

Rest In Peace

For $15, I'd expect multiple areas that would take a few hours each to complete every objective (if you knew where they all were and what to do) and more control options, like being able to pick things up and drop them, land on trees, stuff like that.

$20 more of the same

$30 more of the same and also multiplayer

$40 fully voiced story involving other bird characters

$60 a romance subplot between multiple possible other pigeons,

â

$80 collectors edition with digital art book that will be easily downloaded elsewhere, a pigeon keychain and a pigeon plushy.

$150 Ultimate edition includes all of the above, season pass and a live pigeon.

Pre-order the collectors edition to have your name included, the ultimate to have an npc named after you. Pre-ordering the regular edition earns you the flying rat skin and thumbs up emote, plus exclusive in game tag.

Like you've crashed on some inhospitable world, and you've got to collect the materials to rebuild your camp/ship and get off world. Meanwhile, you're being pursued by some invincible enemies. You can't kill them. You can only slow them down and find a place to hide. Imagine melting your way through a stone face while some multi armed *thing* crawls after you. The only light you can see comes from that melted rock. Imagine some mutated create stumbles across your hiding spot. You start running. You use you melt-er to topple some rocks and block off the path behind you. You can hear the creatures climbing the rock whilst your weapon recharges, and all you can do is search for an old hole to hide in.   
Imagine melting some rock bridge and watching it crumble. Imagine melting the rock beneath you and discovering an underground cavern. Using your melt-er to explore tunnels or some ancient, forgotten catacombs would be incredible. Imagine... Ridley Scott's Prometheus mixed with No Man's Sky. But idk  
You've designed something great there my guy. The possibilities are pretty much endless"	pos
"Focused blasts of the effect could revolutionize Laser and Plasma weaponry VFX, imho. This is damn cool! How much of a stretch is it to apply the effect to character models?

Imagine your laser rifle literally destroying and punching through an NPC, or through terain. Or imagine using a plasma thrower to melt cover out from in front of a dug in position.

Lots of super cool potential in the sifi-FPS space."	pos
Damn that's lit af.I wonder if you could do this stuff alone then what you would be able to achieve in a company	neg
"I'd play the hell out of a game like this. I just hope it doesn't suffer from that floating rock syndrome. It would need to have some sort of physics taken into account the type of rock and the strain of having most of it's support melted away so it'd crumble away etc.

You could make an entire game based on this type of interaction alone. Like Portal only melting shit. Mixing different types of elements or cutting paths for water or making holes to accomplish various goals. 

I could see this being super fun."	pos

Happens in TV all the time. Just take modern family. They had an original concept, which did really well, but everything has a lifetime, and nobody wanted to except that. So you start stretching episodes and story arcs and then they start to lose content and character. Enough time passes and the show is unrecognizable. Adventure time season 1 was a great cartoon. The last season made me want to throw up. 

Also happens relentlessly in video games. Look at how much ""balancing"" fortnite has done to make the game more fun for the millions of trash 7 year-olds that play and buy skins with their parents credit cards. Took all the joy and strategy out of the game for me.

Same thing is happening with Ubisoft right now with R6 Seige and expansion into the chinese market. They're releasing it in china for the huge player base there and all the revenue they'll bring, which is understandable. But they then decided that they didn't want to work for the extra profit and would rather just change the game everyone knows to fit the regulations of the Chinese government. And the players are not happy.

But thats just the way the world works. Money above all. "	pos

"There will be a flurry of inevitable comparisons to microtransactions, and how they might be the same/different from trading card games, baseball cards, etc.

[Here's a podcast about loot boxes with regards to gambling](https://headgum.com/robot-congress/robot-congress-52-are-loot-boxes-gambling-ft-marc-whipple), in which several attorneys (one of which is a bona fide gambling attorney) discuss the subject ad infinitum, including their relation to trading cards.  All the base info you could want on the subject.  In comparison to, say, Magic cards, the contrast comes down to perceived/expected value based  on what you're paying for cards, versus what one might expect from a loot box."	pos

"Unsurprisingly, the Bioware games people still talk about today are not the ones they made based on market research."	neg
"I wonder how many of the people who upvote and agree with this are still completely unable to see that the whole ""Diversity"" thing is a cash-grab based on market research.

The intent is to rinse as much money from as many demographics as possible, all the while presenting the entire operation as something charitable and gaining a few nice PR points along the way.  You really think they're doing it out of the goodness of their corporate hearts?  They just want your money.  They want everyone's money.  If you're already a customer, they're already getting it.  If you're in an untapped demographic which they haven't managed to exploit yet, in comes the ""Diversity"" to save the day.  Who do you think is handling that shit?  It's corporate.  It's advertising.  It's market research. 

And gamers and journalists alike defend it so long as they use the magical PR words which you're not allowed to confront.  It makes people bury their heads in the sand and deny it for fear of looking like a bad person.  ""Why shouldn't a game appeal to every possible person?  You're not a bigot, are you?  This should be celebrated!""

Gamers are complete marks who have been played and defend their players.  The entire industry has been poisoned and I'm sure most in this thread helped that to happen and will continue to deny how they have actually fought against true artistic freedom.  

So yeah, you with your fucking Twitter lynch mobs who think every game has to cater to every sexuality, race, religion and more, who have targeted developers for their work and pressure them into being more sanitised and corporate-friendly - Fuck off, you useful idiot for corporate greed.  You made this happen."	pos
Great. Now I can be extra salty when I get blue shelled two times in a row.	pos

"Here is the problem with Nintendo Games. The games are meant primarily for young kids.  News flash!  Young kids cant read yet every kids game requires somebody to read the bubbles in order to get through the game play.  I assume the budget for such games is so much smaller that they cannot afford to pay for the voice overs. 
For kids they may as well be watching a peanuts cartoon when the mom talks in jibberish"	pos

I totally thought it was an NPC tutorial at first and was like wow this is the best tutorial ever. He showed me how to control my character and play ball in the game. Although, I didn't stay on too long cause I was about to barf, it was nice too see that there are some nice people gaming out there willing to help."	pos

Recently my daughter discovered Minecraft, however, and I feel like Im living through her. I remember the excitement at thinking *you* were the person to figure something out in a game. She has so much fun its infectious. It reminds me of my dad who definitely went through the same cycle. I always assumed he was humoring me when he said he had fun just watching me play. Now I know it may have been true."	pos
"Skyrim truly is open to any kind of person weather deliberate or not.

I recently built a monster PC gaming rig, and when he came to visit, he thought it was awesome and obviously wanted to play. I fired up Borderlands 2 and he went to town. I eventually drifted off to bed only to discover the next morning that he had stayed up all night playing even though the FOV settings were making him nauseous."	pos

"The falling in this game pisses me off because it's different for the difficulty level of the run.  Fall in an easy one and you tumble ten feet down the slope and get up.  Fall in hard and you tumble three hundred yards, even on a flat fucking surface, always right past the checkpoint is where you stop so you can't go backwards and you have to restart.  I get it, it's a hard run and that's one of the things that makes it hard (beside the fact that for some reason skiing or boarding on ice and smooth rock causes you injury), but the continuous tumbling on snowy, powdery, not steep slopes is annoying because IRL you put your fucking arms out and stop yourself. 

Other than that, I love this game. "	neg
"Yeah its a good time. I got it on launch on he Xbox. Wasnt really into it. It was a snow based game with no real idea. 

Picked it up on sale the other week everything is silently hoped they would add had been added. Clear progression a little menu of stuff you should probably have a go at 

Grabbed the season pass and Winter Olympics dlc. And it turned a game I had written off previously into a game I will just sit and find myself still playing hours later without really accomplishing anything. Just dicking about in the snow. "	pos

"Legit, I had a random npc engagement where 2 guys were beating someone up. One on each side and this defenceless guy in the middle. I drew my gun, dead eyed and accidentally shot all 3 of them. The lawmen came and I went to surrender, but instead of talking to them I accidentally hip fired at the guy and killed him.

I ran away whilst being shot trying to figure out wtf just happened and how to stop it getting worse...I was so busy running and thinking that I didnt see the cliff edge in the dark and ran right off it and died. I had to pay $32.50 for the bounty, I only had $30...

I went hunting and sold some hides and walked into the sheriff office to pay my bounty and instead he gave me a bounty to hunt...I later learned I have to go to the station/post office place to pay off my bounty. 

All because I wanted to help some guy and messed it up"	neg

"This is a coincidence. If it were intentional, the buildings would not be side by side but staggered instead, like the actual twin towers. Also, the vertical lines are not consistent with the original buildings.

As someone whos worked in 3D animation and VFX, this is likely just a result of the proxy reflection map on that particular surface. This might be due to the fact that real-time reflections are processor intensive. The designers probably opted for pre-baked/ cached reflections.

In fact, I bet if you look hard enough at other reflective buildings, youll see more inconsistencies with regards to the reflections not matching the environment. "	pos

But they fail to realize that getting these badass in game cosmetics was the main reason most people kept playing the game in the first place, Gamers keep playing in order to unlock these extra cosmetics. Its what gave most games more replayability, Because you could just focus on the main story on your first play through and then play it again to try to get the side missions to unlock some new badass armor or cosmetic, But now they barred this off into a paywall. The rewards you get in video games are the entire reason we play and want to play the games. But since they now charge you for any cool cosmetics you took out half the reason we play games. 

most new games dont even have a good gripping story to keep you interested and fail miserably at this."	pos

"A dynamic that instantly makes me stay away from such games. I already feel hungry irl from time to time, I don't need a game to remind my stomach that it's time to eat lol 

Nah, but seriously, I don't like being constantly limited by an annoying meter. Only survival game I finished was Subnautica and that's because I have a fascination for the deep sea (and was also able to turn off hunger/thirst meters)."	neg
"It depends on how you implement it.

For example I hate games were resources are limited. Meaning you can't be self sufficient. 

Good example of game like that is State of Decay. This serve a purpose tho. Basically you clear up resources around you and you are forced to take longer trips. Taking more risks. 

I prefer survival games that are more about resource management. So you setup production of clean water, food etc. And goal is to balance growth and production. Maybe defend your resources. Stuff like that.

So for example if you take more survivors to your camp, you can do more work around it but at the same time you need to maintain higher food production and if something will mess that up people will starve or you need to ehkm... Reduce population. Something like that."	neg
"Can we talk about the term RPG?

The RPG section of game stores is total trash. The term means nothing since every game you play a role. If I want to play an RPG (turn based like it was when I was a kid), the category has literally every game in there.

Destiny 2, ark, my time at Portia and final fantasy 7 do not belong in the same category."	pos
"This encapsulates It Lurks Below so much. It was solo developed by the mastermind behind Diablo 1 and 2 David Brevik. The game is essentially D1 and D2 in a Terraria setting and its fun af, but its default gamemode has survival elements such as hunger and needing to sleep. I played the game for quite a long time but then softlocked myself because I ran out of food and wasn't able to grow it quick enough since I was using some of the food to also grow more food, so my gameplay devolved into standing on the surface waiting for my crops to grow, dying to hunger and then waiting again.

There is a gamemode without the survival elements, but since it wasn't the default I didn't pick it expecting the survival elements to be fairly easy to manage as it usually is with survival games, I was wrong."	neg

If you can cram in more frames though, it might be worth the extra time to follow through the effects and make them linger in space. The character animation is great, but the effects are just kind of strobing, rather than animating."	pos

The rarity percentages are only based off PSN accounts registered to their website.

When I look at my Oddworld New and Tasty Platinum it says it is far more common than the 0.8% it is given on the PSN trophy tracker.

The percentages displayed when you look at the trophies while on your Playstation is far more accurate. The only trophies not tracked there are players that NEVER connect their console to the internet."	pos

"Basic game design principles?  Black Flag's entire schtick was based around water given that it was a game about pirates on ships... you're going to be in the water by necessity, a lot, and so also by necessity they need to spend time programming shit like that because it's important to the game and the overall experience.  If Legion doesn't have you doing much of anything in the water, then it's less important.  It's why the driving models in racing games are usually better than general open world games.  It's why the water in Sea of Thieves looks and animates like it does while in flight games, nobody gives a shit about the water because you're 5,000 feet up in the air 99% of the time.  We really don't need games to take any longer to develop because we're having devs do stupid shit like spend 6 months accurately coding 3D water, water physics, QA testing it, iterating upon it, etc etc etc in a game where you spend 1% of your time on/in the water.  That time is better spent elsewhere."	neg
"As a gamedev there are a number of reasons for this, and please, do not hate the game for being different!  
1. Slowing down or impeding the player can cause a negative reaction so in as many cases as possible, it's removed, as seen between the comparisons (lessons learnt over time)  
2. The target audience and games had completely different focus'... One was a Sea based game where the majority of the play-time was on water, whereas the other was a City-scape with minimal water.  
3. The development time and art-team effort was spent else where, and again, this is not a bad thing. Calls would have been made and gotten sign off from higher ups to be like, ok, instead of spending a week on a pond water material, spend a week on the entire floor of a building etc.

"The bill text is MADDENINGLY unavailable at this writing, but, based on the title, this seems like a terrible mechanism for stopping the repeal. The title of the bill implies that this bill would prevent the FCC from implementing the Rule it proposed a few weeks ago (the Rule which repeals net neutrality). It does *not* appear from the title that it would do anything to prevent the FCC from proposing another slightly different Rule a few months down the line, nor does it require the FCC to respect the existing Rule that enforces net neutrality. Thus, this bill would not protect net neutrality permanently or completely.

What Congress needs to do to put this thing to bed is formally define ISPs as ""telecommunications services"" within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (as opposed to ""information services""). That's how the Internet worked from 1989 to 2002, and it's a permanent and complete solution that terminates all this stupid fussing around with particular FCC notices and rulemaking periods.

I'm really very annoyed about this. Why would Rep. Patrick put this patch in place instead of fixing it permanently?  Is he trying to keep this debate alive for some reason?  I don't want to be fighting this again next year and the year after.  

But I could be wrong.  I am just speculating based on the title. So I hotly anticipate the bill text actually being posted.

**UPDATE**: thanks to /u/BANANARCHY for posting the [full text](https://imgur.com/a/vcU4R). This is worse than I expected. There's not even a ""no substantially similar"" clause here. I am not a lawyer, but I spend a lot of time reading statutes and federal regulations. As I understand this bill, it will stop the repeal... for a few months. Then the FCC can come right back with the exact same NPRM and do the exact thing all over again. Calling it the ""Save Net Neutrality Act of 2017"" is apropos, because this would save Net Neutrality *only* for 2017.  I don't think reddit ought to support this bill.

I welcome correction or clarification from actual lawyers and/or Rep. Patrick himself and/or his clerks.

**UPDATE 2**: Another problem: if this bill is passed and signed after December 14th, does it even have any legal effect? It does not seem that it would. The new FCC Rule will have gone into effect by then, and this bill expressly rules out the possibility of retroactive impact on already-enacted rules. Since the chance of a bill passing by tomorrow are literally zero -- it takes immense coordination to get even must-pass, popular legislation through the gamut in under 48 hours -- what's the point of this?

Just overrule *Brand X v. NCTA* by defining ISPs as a telecommunications service under the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  It's not complicated!"	pos

"I honestly think CRT was a big reason why Nintendo did not feel any pressure to target HD with the Wii. Had everyone played the 7th gen consoles on CRT TVs, the Wii at 480p would actually look really decent compared to the 360 and PS3. 

The fact that everyone adopted LCD TVs so quickly made the Wii look extra outdated towards the tail end of that console cycle."	pos
"It's fascinating stuff!  


There's a common trend with monitor/TV technology that newer, fancier screens with better resolution sometimes make older games look worse, simply because they weren't designed with upscaling in mind.    


What's happening with current 1080p/4K games on the newest consoles and PCs, is one of the first times so many existing games have gotten retroactively updated for newer tech so quickly. Even for PCs, updates for raytracing function in a similar way, with better shadows and lights utilizing the extra resolution of a 4k or ultrawide monitor."	pos
"I think one of the reasons we remember CRT looking better as a kid is also the image scaling. CRTs don't have individual pixels, they essentially just project an image.

So if you have an original resolution of say 1280x720, but you run it on a larger screen designed for 2560x1440 - on an LCD panel, it needs to fill in those missing pixels by duplicating information from existing ones, so it looks blocky/stretched and just in general looks bad.

On a CRT, if you did the same thing, it isn't adding any extra pixels, it's just projecting that image over a larger space. So the original image doesn't get distorted, and looks great even on that larger monitor.

This effect also makes it look less like images have individual pixels, so almost functions like a sort of natural anti-aliasing.

This is why we actually *remember* CRT looking better, because many of us have had the unfortunate experience of playing some of those same low resolution games on our PC with emulators, only to discover how awful it looks when all stretched out and pixelated looking on an LCD display."	pos

"The micro-transaction culture that has been created in gaming is amazing. 

Blizzard for example: makes a new mount, and even if 100,000 people buy the new mounts for $25 each. They would be able to pay the people who made the mount model, but also have extra for other categories. Blizzards first mount to be purchasable sold 2 million in the first hour ($50,000,000)... 2 million sales for a none-physical item.  That's 60% of what they make in a month at blizzards lowest sub count during mist of pandaria. 

Micro transactions probably will dominate the gaming culture for the foreseeable future; it's just to lucrative. And it's going to be hard to shift the culture away; even if 1% of the game population continues to buy DLCs it would still be worth it to the companies.

"I thought this was just for the Sim 2 at first, and was initially on EA's side for once, but on further review, this guy nails it.

The Sims has been a great Franchise for well over a decade now, but I don't know who can truthfully be honest with themselves and say that the Expansion system isn't a blatant money grab.

Even with the extra content and abilities each game seemed to add over the rest, there was so much additional content lost between games when you add up all of the content removed by losing your expansion packs.

Not only that, but it also felt like each iteration gave you less to start with than the game before it. It was very difficult to get the newest Sims game and not feel disappointed. And you would remain disappointed until you spent money ""upgrading"" it over several different expansions until it felt equal to your previous edition.

I would much rather pay a base fee for the game, and then a small monthly charge to get a additional content regularly throughout the products  life time, than be gashed at every opportunity to get a $60 game to play like a $60 game, but only after investing $200+ additional dollars."	pos

Its not my favourite game from childhood (UFO:Enemy Unknown, Syndicate or the Monkey Island series take that) but when you played it you knew it was special."	pos

"My dad used to write code for the BC government in the 70s. Literally one of Canada's first programmers. We're talking, walk your box of punch cards to the computer room and wait in line for someone to feed them into a computer that took up half the first floor.  

These days he can't manage a Powershell script, but on the other hand asked me for help picking out a mouse with adjustable sensitivity for his work on in some economics program. The buttons are too tiny for him to click on easily with a static sensitivity Dell mouse, and he'd seen me with a bunch of weird mice and understood the application of the sensitivity adjustment and what it would mean for his workflow, so we went and tried different gaming mice at a store until he found one that he liked.  

So now he rocks an XPS13... with a Razer Imperator.

"It took me until I was probably 20 to realize how lucky I was my dad knows so much about computers and my mom was always willing to learn about new technology. Hell my grandpa tried his best to stay on top of things well into his 90s before he died. Granted towards the end he just kept getting viruses and accidentally bogging things down. On the flip side my grandma, used to be mostly on top of things but then one day a VHS got caught and unspooled and she never touched a VCR for the next 20 years. And we had to force her to try to use a dvd player. Anyway this is awesome, appreciate your parents etc. For what they can do and value it. Blah blah blah."	pos
"First, this is super cool.  

Second, for all the comments talking about how their mom doesn't understand anything about batch files etc... I would like to propose that generations are all different.   

My parents can write batch files, and in their heyday were writing programs in various languages. This is back when most people struggled with setting digital clocks, and they were working with rockets.   

My kids on the other hand (one an adult and one in high school) couldn't do intermediate computer commands to save their life. Command prompt? Drivers? Huh?  
The reason is that things are too easy and automatic these days.   

Are my parents geniuses and my kids stupid? ~~Yes~~ Not really, they just dealt with different situations and learned different things. In fact, most people I know can't write a batch file. It's not that strange that your mom can't.   

My point... Don't belittle your mom for something she can't do. Love her for what she can. And call her for heaven's sake.

The look on her face stuck with her for the rest of my carreer. NEVER again did I have to explain to her why I was editing code at 11pm when I was 13 and thst it was vital to finish it before I lost my flow.

Bought my own car when I was 18 (Netherlands driving age) and paid for my own driving license tutoring and exams (>2500 euro's) from the accounting software I wrote for people in my family.

"Adorable. 

My mom wasn't very techy, but as kids we got to play anything and everything we wanted. They didn't care in the slightest.

I was born in 1982, so I remember the 'time before video games'. It wasn't until the mid-90's that we had games in toy stores here; before that you had to visit a specialty shop.

I bought pretty much every shooter, GTA game and other violent stuff as a teen without being denied even once.

The toy store happily sold me Duke Nukem 3D when I was 14. Got GTA when I was 15, etc etc. We played Doom, Wolfenstein well before that, obviously.

The ONLY game mom had a 'problem' with was Carmageddon. This was fairly controversial and in the news in 1997. We played a demo on PC and mom basically said: 'you can play that if you want to, but it's not something I'd buy' which was basically it.  We didn't buy it either because it wasn't as fun.

Nowadays, lots of games make Carmageddon look like a kiddie title :-)

I guess I was lucky un that I got to enjoy all the 90's classics without any restriction."	pos

I don't usually use reddit, but OP reached out to me (via the platform he bought the DS off of me) with the news that he had posted my notecard on reddit and it received lots of unexpected attention, so here I am!  
Don't worry, I wasn't forced to part with it! As I've grown older, I've tried to become somewhat of a minimalist because I'm not a fan of clutter and have tried to practice a mindset where I can place more value into memories than the objects that create them, and so letting go of something I no longer used and seeing someone else enjoy it was more important to me than the money I made off of it. I sold it for the lowest price I found them going for online and didn't expect it to attract so much attention! Thanks for all of the kind comments wishing me well and also for the ones making me laugh ( /u/WeOnlySeeWhatWeAimAt, you had me rolling with the comment about the ""humble line"" through the word ""travelled"" ), I promise that life has been treating me good considering the times and hope that you are all safe and happy as well!

"Storytime:

I have always played a tonne of smash bros. Not competitive, but I'm pretty good and win most of my games if we're playing for serious. That said, I'm more about high items all pokeballs on Pokemon Stadium than fox only final destination.

Playing at my brother's house, one of his buddies who I don't know that well is there. Turns out he plays Marth with the white colour scheme. So do I. So we play a few games, I take white because social rules I guess. I probably won but I don't remember. Fast-forward an hour or two. This guy starts talking about how he was watching EVO recently and he wants to go pro at smash, thinks he can do it. ""Yeah dude, good luck. Those pros are really good though eh."" so what does this fucker say to me? ""I'll duel you for your skin. Marth vs Marth, if I win then only I get to use it.""
My blood pressure rises. Face flushed, heartrate up. I hate turning games into something like that. But I agree. And I say if he loses he can't ever use it.

We set up. 3 stock, no items, FD. I think this was Brawl but it might have been melee. I'm probably not showing it but my heart is pounding and I am in some kind of zone. Now, I've played a lot of games. I've been in a lot of zones. This was the kind of mood as if he'd said to me ""If I win this game, I'm gonna sleep with your mother while you watch."" I cannot recall another time I've been so quietly disturbed. Angry is the wrong word. I was intense. And I was not going to lose.

I three-stocked him. He didn't kill me once. I absolutely demolished him, his dreams of going pro, and his dignity in front of a roomful of friends. His fault, he brought it on himself by putting honour on the line. I was fine if we both used the same colour scheme when possible, who cares.

That is now one of my fondest gaming memories. We were both over 20 at the time, not kids. I haven't seen him since then, been about 4 years and he hangs with a different crowd now. It is my dream that one day I will find him in a room playing white Marth and I will tell him no, he isn't allowed to use that skin. And he will feel the pain of his ego again. 

... I'm a lawyer now and I can't recall ever being as stressed before court as I was before that match.

In the 5mins from setting it up to him walking back to the room I tried everything I could think of to salvage the day.


Eventually with a few minutes to spare I picked up the system about 3-4 off the ground and dropped it hoping that some percussive maintenance would work.

"Depending on what the dress was for, I could understand the 11 yo being upset. My SIL frequently spends hundreds on clothes she doesn't need, but then has no money for her kid (soon to be kids). Her and my BIL keep their money separated, so she uses anything ""extra"" on her end towards her wants vs saving. Plus, she has almost $300k in student loan debts due to getting multiple degrees as she wasn't happy with her first two degrees and prospective jobs. 

My mom wasn't great either. My dad left when I was 14. My dad chose to give her 75% of everything he made after he left, until I was 18. He was in school until I was 16, so he only made about $50k/year doing his residency. She was supposed to use that money to help repair and sell the house, which he didn't ask for anything from the sale other than their joint loans be paid off. Well, I never saw the money, had to buy my own clothes beyond $150 for new school clothes, and I had to beg her to help me with college at one point because I wouldn't get enough in grants due to her making so much money (she was an RN working at a hospital). I later found out, all the extra money my dad was giving her that didn't get used on me was suppsoed to go to my college. She pretended she was the only one who helped me with college, and my dad didn't do shit. He bought all my textbooks and he had already given her money she could have put away for my college.

"I used to play a game where the mobs had an actual inventory.  They dropped their inventory on death.  Then they added a spell that let you disarm enemies, which would put the weapon in their inventory.  This was allowing players to get a weapon that was not intended for players to wield.  They made the weapon too heavy for even the strongest player to pick up, but they forgot about a few items so they did the math wrong.  Day after the spell went in, people were rolling characters just to pick up the weapon.  Everyone fucking had them.

They introduced two fixes:

- Redid the math, and made them actually too heavy to pick up. \(anyone who already had one equipped could keep it, but they could never put it down or let it break.  In this game, you dropped random items on death, so it was a certainty you would lose it eventually.\)  Some players kept using them.  Some players had them stuck permanently to the floor in their home.
- Made mobs do a check every turn.  Am I unarmed?  Am I carrying a weapon?  If both are true, equip it.

Enter devils.  Devils are naturally unarmed.  Devils also drop the two best weapons in the game.  Devils are not exempt from this check.  You may see where this is going.  Devils were a commonly farmed mob because they were fairly high level, but actually kind of sucked because they didn't hit very hard.  Except now, if they had the best weapons in the game, they would equip it.  Not only does this mean that you wouldn't get it anymore, since mobs don't drop anything that's equipped, it also means this ordinarily weak high level character is going to be using it against you.  Their damage is now way higher, and they also gain an extra swing every round.  As mentioned earlier, you often drop your equipment on death, sometimes losing it.  Weapons were pretty disposable, and everyone lost a few.  The upside was that good weapons  including the best in the game  were not rare.  Everyone had one, because they dropped all of the time.  Unless they had the one I mentioned before, that they weren't supposed to have, obviously.  This meant it was nearly a certainty that a devil would pull one on you eventually.  They never fixed that."	neg

My favorite part about the navy.  The base I was at had a game room where we would hook up 4 xboxes with 16 guys playing halo 1 and 2 split screen.

"I love how this has almost 100k upvotes, when I tried to get this very simple point across people went absolutely crazy

Obviously not every review of a game will be valid to you, they're opinions, but maybe if a large majority of people reviewing said game say it's dogshit you might wanna not waste money on a game as soon as it releases, you're the sole reason companies like EA haven't gone bankrupt because if we stopped buying shit games they would stop making shit games

And before I get the usual ""ohhh but a bad game is completely subjective"" response, first of all, don't forget to breathe because it's healthy to do so. You know damn well what I mean by a shit game and if you wanna act all different saying you enjoy said games then go ahead, praise EA for making the same game every year for example and instead of holding onto a last iteration because general quality, do go on to spend an absurd ammount of money on the game and maybe even specific console, because that is obviously the smart thing to do.

A bad game can be very well defined by just being a game that in comparison to today's standards lacks on all parts, be it story, gameplay, graphics, etc. Most people are buying EXPENSIVE MOBILE GAMES BUT WITH A LARGE FILE SIZE GRADE GAMES for their already expensive PC and consoles, people are being absolutely milked out of their wallets and what are they doing? Buying bad company's awful ass games and then complaining about it

But it's useless to complain about all of these things because everyone here seems to shit cash so they don't even bother having wasted 60 or smth on a bad, unfinished, buggy, eye pain inducing mess of code.

People have to wake up, companies like money, not you. I call bullshit if you know about that if you're still preordering games and buying on release without even thinking about it. It's the kind of consumerist mob mentality that practically everyone has here that's doing everyone harm.

Go on, downvote me to hell because you can't stand reading something that is actually true and doesn't get it's basis off your perfect world"	neg
"Sigh.

I think its funny how people care how people spend their money. Getting upset about 50% of the problem - thinking its the main problem itself.

Im going to preorder. Not out of spite. But because I can afford it. And since when have we experienced a Pre-order based PR disaster with God Of War?

If it turns into one - guess what? Thats on ME.

Unless you want to frame that as being a problem YOU have to experience. At least Im accepting Im part of the problem - albeit for God of (Fucking) War. 

Its not like this is Madden, CoD, Battlefront, or GTA V for the PS5."	neg

"Well, I expected more tbh. The graphics didn't amaze me, and it looked like the same game with only a different story that follows God Of War. I was thinking on pre-order it, but now I'm not so sure. Also, this game shouldn't exist for PS4. Only a trailer, but I think they didn't use alot of PS5 capacities.

The difference with digital is that you can't sell it.

"Gaming is like gambling nowadays. Every purchase is a bet. Who would've imagined that cyberpunk would be such a disaster? Let's remember that the early reviews from it were majorly positive because many websites don't even play the games properly before reviewing. Sources like twitch and many youtubers are way better to share information than these ""journalists"". In the end of the day hype is a human thing and if you can wait to play a certain game you should do it...but if you can't I don't see a problem with pre order. Just don't fall for ""special editions"" that only add useless content"	pos

That shit drives me crazy. Especially if its at the beginning? Nothing keeps me from wanting to do a second play through than a 10 minute unskippable cutscene to open the game."	neg

"I'm usually fine with story cutscenes. If the story is good...

My biggest pet peeve are micro-cutscenes. Example: You walk into a room and the game decides to take control away from you so you can watch your character admire the scenery. Developers, if the scenery you've designed is as admirable as you think it is, I'll admire it myself on my own! You have my word. Do not make me!

Even worse are in-combat micro-cutscenes. Characters performing dramatic maneuvers, enemies busting through the decorations, that sort of thing... It completely ruins the flow.

If you make me watch a cutscene - skippable or unskippable - it better move the plot forward! Otherwise, don't bother!"	pos

"Level scaling can be done well.  It requires a lot more work than companies are willing to put in, though.  

I'd enjoy level scaling if I gained a tool that let me gain an advantage or counter to an enemy that also gained a new tool to use against me.  I don't enjoy it when it's just 'abstract numbers are now bigger'.

It's great that my sneak attack does more damage but if there's no enemies extra vulnerable to sneak attacks or resistant to non-sneak attacks, it's really no different than just a straight damage increase.  

Similarly, if I go from 100 health to 110 health and the enemy goes from 10 damage to 11 damage, I'm still losing 10% of my health bar each time I get hit.  It's a useless change."	neg

"When I was about 14 the GameCube had just come out and there was a Luigi's Mansion promotion where you played a flash game where you spot and click on ghosts. It was simple and easy and you could play up to three times a day for Email entries. The grand prize was a Gamecube with a copy of Luigi's Mansion.

 So I did it every day for about two weeks and when the promotion was over I stopped thinking about it. People don't actually win online contests, after all. 

Cut to a couple weeks later when I get an email telling me I had won and they just needed an address to ship my prize to. My cynicism disappeared instantly as I started geeking. 

I told my best friend immediately. This was the first and last time I ever used a payphone in my life. It was so important to me to share this news that I ran two blocks down the road to a payphone because I couldn't wait for my family to be done with the internet. (There's a concept I don't miss)

My friend laughed and said someone was probably just messing with me since I talked about wanting a GameCube all the time. He was so sure that he promised to buy a controller for me so we could play two player games if it turned out to be real. 

I told my parents next. I got a pretty stern lecture about information privacy and why I shouldn't give my address out to everyone who asks for. It online. 

My dad was so sure I was getting scammed that he promised to buy me a game of my choosing if it turned out to be real.

"I should just post my thoughts on the ending now before this thread gets out of control. In short, I LOVE IT!

Episode 3, as it is written here, would have perfectly ending the series and Laidlaw absolutely captures the general theme of the games. The central one being that the universe is simply too vast and complex for any one little human to understand. Everything about this final episode is building you towards this eventual revelation. It starts as your bog standard story as all the characters attempt to obtain the magical MacGuffin that will solve all their problems and allow them to finally beat the Combine.

However, once they board the Borealis they realize just how little the understand the science of what the original research team was tapping into. The witness time itself unfolding and refolding. The past, the present, and the future all laid bare before them as they travel across vast distances in space, in and instant and an eternity, until they are stretched to encompass all the space in between. This is but their first glimpse into the reality that awaits them. After Alex decides to shoot Elizabeth Mossman and use the Borealis to blow up the Combine base, the reality of our situation is laid bare before the player.

The G-Man shows up, but this time it isn't to save us, it's to take Alex away. In fact, he doesn't even speak to us. We aren't even worth a thought to him. And, we as the player begin to learn the truth, we were never special. There was nothing unique about us that the G-Man needed or saw within us, we were nothing more than a disposable pawn, to be discarded and forgotten about based on his whims. The G-Man, much like the universe, is cold and uncaring. He takes Alex with him and they move on, without you.

Finally, we pilot the ship to detonate inside the Combine Base only to have the final truth revealed to us. Our efforts have always bee futile, the Combine are so power and their reach so vast that it is beyond our comprehension. They control worlds beyond worlds we've ever dreamed of, their tentacle reach exists in dimensions we never knew existed, their web is as vast as the arm of a galaxy. And, our last ditch suicidal effort won't even register as a spark in the grand scheme of their plans. 

And then, the player is yanked back to their world, Earth. When? Who knows? Did we win the war? Does it matter? The player has the truth of the universe opened to them at the brink of death and then pulled away. The universe and everything that goes on within it is beyond our comprehension. Our efforts, our friends, our losses all seem minuscule and pointless in the grand scheme of things. We were just a child trying to grasp at concepts beyond our reach; smashing our hands at perceived obstacles in our path.

And, that is exactly how the series started. When we pushed that element into the beam back in Black Mesa untold horrors beyond our comprehension were unleashed. We had no explanation about what they were, what they wanted, or why they did what they did. It all seemed chaotic. The only thing we could try to do was survive and attempt to close this portal into the incomprehensible madness. By the end, we fought some alien god only to be pulled through time and space by the mysterious figure who seemed interested in us the whole game. The game started with confusion and ended without any questions resolved, only more chaos.

HL2 attempted to lull us into a fall sense of security about everything and our purpose. Our enemy now had a name, The Combine. They had an objective, the conquering of our world. They even had a sort of order/hierarchy. These are concepts that made sense to our human mind, and an enemy we knew how to fight. Right until the ending of Episode 2...

This Episode 3 ending caps off the theme of Half-Life by bringing us back to the original. There is no structure, no comprehension, you were never meant to understand the Combine or the universe for that matter. The only solace you can gain is that you saw the truth of the futility of your struggle, whereas others would never learn the reality of the situation.

You the player are not special and you can never understand the reality of the universe you exist within.

EDIT:

Holy Shit!!! I wrote my thoughts on this ending before I went to bed and wake up now to see it's blown up. Well, thanks for the Gold, strangers.

Couple quick thoughts:
-Some have said that this ending is ""too edgy"" appealing only to teenage nihilists. I disagree, I think it's classic Sci-Fi and works quite well with the overall story, themes, and tone of Half-Life. The game has always attempted to show you just how little you as a human can comprehend about what is going on. As I said, the first game ends with the G-Man teleporting your around dimensions before offering you a ""choice"" to come with him on a magic tram car. And, then the next game you wake up some decade or so later on a tram car without even the courtesy to explain how or why you were brought to this point. If you wanted ""solid"" answers to questions within the HL universe, such as what is the G-Man? Then you've been playing the wrong series. You were never meant to understand things like that and explaining them would ruin the themes of the series.

-""Did the lungfish refuse to breathe air? It did not. It crept forth boldly while its brethren remained in the blackest ocean abyss, with lidless eyes forever staring at the dark, ignorant and doomed despite their eternal vigilance."" Dr. Breen summed up the Resistance pretty well, he understood the true might of the Combine and the Universe."	neg
"Seems like it would have been a good Episode 3. Not the closure we were waiting for, but it's not like you can wrap up this story in one go.

And it seems Alyx would've been the main character in Half Life 3, if they went through with it.

But all of this is void now. Seems like if they do make another HL, it'll be out of desperation. Which might or might not happen. And it won't have this story."	pos
"I guarantee you. Today or very soon a group of die hard Half Lifers are sitting down in the pre phase to create this game. No matter the graphics etc. The story/game will be made. I think they won't use Half Life 3 because of copyright, but they will complete this story in game form. I mean HL3 or HLIII should be fair game?! Hope this happens and I bet an indie studio does it. Because I guarantee valve isn't. Especially with this story release. This is their ""fare well, we didn't (want to) end up making Half life 3 (for some insane reason)"""	pos

"My grandmother and her hairdresser would meet up every Friday to play the latest NES titles, with a particular focus on Mario & Zelda games. When the SNES came out, they were first in line.

A year or so after they started playing, she bought my family an NES in exchange for some roofing work that my dad did for her. We'd never have been able to afford one otherwise.

She passed away early last year, and I still have so many Zelda cartridges with her old save files. My daughter and I had to call her a few years ago for directions in the original LoZ. Though her favorite was Link's Awakening (played on Super Gameboy so she could see!).

"I just realized my brother was about 20 when Zelda launched and he played it. Hes in his mid 50s now and its one of the only games hes kept up with over the decades. All his consoles that he owns he bought for Zelda, and for his kids but mostly so he could play lol"	pos
"I remember he was at a skate park in cincy I went to....

*flashback*

Back when I played youth soccer I remember seeing the house of a girl in my class near the fields. If you know cincy, it has some hills. Now they had a full half pipe built next to the house because their dad was a big skateboarder. Seeing such a sight on a hill made me even more scared and respectful of the sport I would soon come to know. 

Fast forward to middle school and the skater phase. Turns out, the dad opened a skate park and knew tony hawk somehow through skating (obviously). So we were there and he showed up. It was like youre playing basketball at the rec and MJ shows up ready for space jam.  Seeing a god in his element was so cool, and his passion and encouragement for us was pure awesome. 

Just a little nostalgic moment for me when I saw this because I loved playing that game. "	pos

"Hi all,

Holy shit this blew up. Thanks for spreading the word. One request: While I appreciate the words of support that are being emailed to gmail account, it is getting flooded with messages right now and its hard to sift through. Please save your kind words for the comment section. Don't want to miss the guy's email if he does turn up. Thanks!

Also if you think this is yours, send an email not a pm on Reddit! 

UPDATE:

First of all, thank you to everyone who has helped share this. Amazed by the reach of the internet. 

Second, I went to the MTA Lost & Found to drop off one of the flyers (some here suggested that) instead of dropping off the item incase the owner checks there. They wouldnt accept it. Its a policy against 3rd party items being left. I tried to explain the flyer had be seen a lot on the internet and I was worried about fraudsters. They wouldnt budge. Bummer. https://imgur.com/gallery/N0vLbRe

Ive seen a 50/50 split in the comments about if I should turn the games over to the MTA. Some say definitely no and others say definitely yes. Theres pros and cons to doing either at this point. But the virality of this post makes me hopeful hell reach out via email.

Ive gotten a few emails that seemed like they might be the owner, but upon further questioning holes started appearing in their stories. Mostly that people refused to meet in person. Yes, there is a lot of info than can be gleaned from my initial photo that a fraudster can use to appear legit, but there are things that only the owner would know about the case and games.

Now some clarifications:

This isnt some marketing scam. Im a New Yorker who saw a crummy thing happen to another New Yorker right in front of me and wanted to try and fix it. The subway commute sucks. Why not try and make it suck a little less? 

Yes, I have posted this multiple times to multiple Reddit threads. I tweeted it too. Of course my goal was to make it go viral. What chance would I have of finding the guy otherwise? Yes #PlayItForward is an eye rolling-ly bad pun. But I wanted people to remember the flyer and share it. Glad that the vast majority of you arent cynics our there. 

I appreciate the kind words and that people find so much hope in this tiny little act. TBD if we find this guy, but please continue to share and just remember to be kind to each other. Like I said, the world sucks enough. Try and make it less suck-y."	pos

As a girl gamer, I'm playing Stellaris online, Noita with my bf, satisfactory when I'm on my own, and have built many computers (job is IT). Also Animal Crossing, Portal, moonlighter, astroneer, etc. I have a MYST tattoo. 

what did I start with? The Sims, miscellaneous edutainment franchises, and Barbie games when I visited friends. Now granted I wasn't allowed action games of any sort till I was 16. Dad thought games melted your brain :(

And the funny thing? I remember those barbie games fondly. They were a gateway to basic management and upgrade systems. Were they kinda shitty? Absofuckinglutely. But they were fun, and I liked them.

So just.... Just because they're buying the shitty stuff now doesn't mean they will forever. And at least they're having fun :)"	pos

"That was the best part of Morrowind. As others have noted, the search turned into an adventure, augmented by the fact that there were hidden nooks and crannies with valuable/unique gear everywhere. That was my biggest gripe with subsequent games, random loot everywhere was a huge misstep in my opinion, it was hard to get motivated for exploration by being rewarded with 15th glass sword with 3 fire damage. There was like 1 whole set of Daedric armour in the game (and another on a critical story npc) scattered across the whole map and it was really exciting when you found a piece on a hidden ledge that was only accessed by using a Levitation spell/potion (remember when we could do that?). Or going to some random rocks that were far south of Ebonheart out in the sea and you thought were just for show, but once you get there you find an ancient Dwemer ruin under the water and at the end there's a Dwemer closet with one of the best pieces of chest armour in the game waiting for you...

"For those who don't know, this mechanic was directly inspired by Valve's cancelled ""F-Stop"" project, which was a gameplay feature originally planned for Portal 2, before it was removed to be used in its own title and then scrapped all together. There have been several attempts to make independent games using this mechanic, some of them being earlier versions of this particular game. Based on the gameplay I've watched, this is probably the most polished version we'll see on the market. The makers understand how Valve designs games and have faithfully replicated that ethos in game. Just watching it felt like seeing a lost Valve title. I expect Valve will be very interested with this team once they catch word of this."	pos

"As a game dev, I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how you did this. I've been looking at this for an hour thinking about scaling and maybe judging the scale value based on the distance form object collisions, but that doesn't take into account the fact that the change is based on perspective so the item stays the same scale until you release it, at which point it scales. GAH MY BRAIN HURTS!"	neg
"They don't even design mobile games to be games. They design them based entirely around making money as easily as possible.

They plan things to give free to play players just enough to get into the game, but not enough to ever be truly successful. There'll be lots of super expensive purchases only targeted at whales but tons of 'cheap' packs of stuff to buy for the average player that add up over time.

Most of these games will even try to lure players to click the purchase button. You finish a battle or whatever and on the bottom right of the screen will be the button to go back to town/home/whatever. Only sometimes there'll be a popup for some limited time pack of stuff to buy and the purchase button is suddenly on the bottom right of the screen where you've been conditioned to tap already.

If you love making video games and want to make games as a career, make real games. If you want to make video games to make money, go into the mobile gaming market."	pos

He started getting really salty about been forced to run back to his place to unload everything every 10 min. Viewers started to point out he didn't had to pick up everything since most things are junks or not worth the extra effort. 

He had about 25 viewers and everyone got banned."	neg

Having a weight carrying limit is actually pretty fun from an immersive point of view. It lets me organize my inventory to the bare essentials and selling extra items from a dungeon crawl feels more rewarding.

"There were many nights when I would slowly wake up to the bright light of my TV being turned on at the foot of my bed. My mom would sometimes sneak into my room so she could play Pokemon Puzzle League on my N64.

She would usually make me be quiet while she played, but I was allowed to silently watch. Sometimes she would turn around and ask me what I thought her best move would be, but she was honestly way better at that game than I ever was as a 6 year old. 

She was a stay at home mom who literally had no down time. My dad would come home and expect there to be dinner ready for him, and then she was expected to clean up after dinner, do the dishes, laundry, etc. Even as a little 6 year old boy I understood that this was sacred quiet time for my mom to focus on something that wasn't about her family. It was her ""me"" time. Those images of my mom framed in the TV light at the bottom of my bed are some of my fondest childhood memories. "	pos
"I remember one of the first games I got for N64 was Star Wars: Shadow of the Empire. Sometimes when I'd get stuck on a level I'd ask my dad to beat it for me. I don't think he really liked video games or anything - I'm sure he'd much rather have played catch or something outside - but he'd play for hours to beat those levels for me because he wanted to spend time with me and my brothers, and that's what we wanted to do. It's one of the fondest memories I have of him. Anyway, at some point I asked him to beat the sewer level for me, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't take down that tentacle boss. Then one day I managed to do it for myself. After that I knew what I had to do. I killed him and took his place as ruler of the family. Old man shouldn't have shown weakness."	neg

Next thing i know my cousin Sam woke us up inviting us over to her room. She woke my brother and I up around 1am. Mind you i never stay up late so this was new to me. She told us to follow her and  to my suprise she was eating mac and cheese in her room. Apperently she just arrived from her late retail shift and asked if we wanted to play video games. My brother and I nodded with enthusiam. We ended up playing a racing game called twisted metal i think until 3:30am. It was probably the highlight of my life then.

The next morning, I came downstairs to watch Saturday morning cartoons, only to find my dad glued to the television (apparently he stayed up the whole night). He looked up at me and exclaims with far too much enthusiasm ""I got to BOWSER!"". I had no fuckin clue what he was talking about. "	pos
"My sister and I got the NES from ""Santa"" for Christmas. When we hooked it up and started to play we could hardly jump over the first hole. My dad, a computer programmer, on the other hand was flying through levels and finding ways to warp to later levels and we asked how he was doing so well he just responded ""I work with computers.""
Years later when we are older he tells us that for about 2 months before Christmas after we would go to sleep here was playing Mario and Duck Hunt. He just packaged it all back up for us before Christmas. "	pos
I remember my dad doing the same for me and my sister with Zelda games. After a few times he became addicted to it and played it all the time while my sister and I watched. My mom became so angry about it because all we did was play the game and on the dinner table we talked only about the game. She was totally excluded.  i miss the times when everything was ok at home	neg
I feel like mom's were hotter back in the day 	pos
"I remember my mom playing Sonic 2 on the genisis. She had all chaos emeralds and was Super Sonic, and she was also playing with the debug cheat. Then we got Sonic & Knuckles, I don't remember her playing that one but I remember she was in bed a lot as she had cancer. She watched me play and I wanted to beat the game so she could see the ending but I died on the stupid fire level where the death egg is in the background and Robotnik is destroying the platforms. All lives lost and went back to level one, too much work to get back there so I turned it off to try again later, which never happened as she died. Then my brothers and I got Sonic 3 and we connected it to Sonic & Knuckles to make it into one game and we were discovering all these cool secrets and I even beat it. As I beat it I recall thinking ""I wish she could see this"" "	neg
"When I was four I told my dad I wanted a PS2. He told me that we could get one but I'd have to sell some of my kid toys to help pay for it. We put every Thomas the Train and Veggie Tale video I had on eBay. Rescue Heroes, Army Men, & all sorts of other little trinkets were sold also. We finally had everything sold and shipped off so we went down to Wal Mart and got the holy grail of gaming. I held that box in my lap all the way home as if I needed it to live. The first game we played was the awful Mummy movie adaption and I loved it more than anything on this planet. Anyways, over the next few years me and my dad played games on that PlayStation every day and night for hours on end. 007, Medal of Honor, FreekStyle, Jack and Dexter, Crash Bandicoot, etc. 

Way later on, after my parents got divorced and I moved in with my mom, he bought us both an Xbox 360 and Live. We'd play CoD 2 & Perfect Dark Zero over Xbox Live just as much as we'd play the old PS2. This continued on to Halo 3 where we spent countless hours playing matchmaking and trying to beat the game on Legendary. 

Now we both have Xbox Ones and we still play CoD or Battlefield regularly. No matter what's going on in life we're always still grinding out 6 hour sessions and trying to play better than the other.

I don't know why I felt the need to share this but I feel like video games get a lot of hate outside of the internet. They've done nothing but build a stronger bond between my dad and I over that past 17 years.

My mom used to have to beat the first level in The Simpsons Game on DS for me cause I couldn't get one jump in it. Strange cause I could do every other level except the last one. That last level was so frustrating for me that it cost me a ds cause when I was 6 I was playing the game and got so frustrated that I took the ds and snapped it in half. I hid that sucker for months until my mom wanted to play brain games or something and I had to give up the evidence.	neg

"My dad used to spend all night playing Zelda: Ocarina of Time when we got stuck on a level. My mom would find him down in our basement all bleary eye'd still playing early in the morning, and she'd ask him what he was doing. He always would say ""I gotta beat this level so the kids can explore the next area."" He still talks about it to this day. He always said he didn't like game so much, but I think deep down he really loved that game. "	pos

Xbox was trying to see if they could get away with raising the price and getting some extra cash I'm glad they listened to us though and didn't go through with it	pos
"Considering that the price of games havent really changed with inflation (there even used to be some $70 SNES games back in the day) and yet the costs have increased with all the extra work needed. 

Especially the costs of making 4K assets compared to 1080p or lower; I dont think its exactly wild to see them charging more for something that literally costs them more to make."	pos

Told me he was going to a business trip for 2 weeks and then didn't contact me or appear online for the next couple months.
After reaching out to his wife months later... I found out that he passed away because of a liver failure.
Rip brad. You will always live on in my heart.

PS : I'm sorry that I had you read such a sad story... But I felt the need to share it, since I see his profile on my steam's friends list and some other games everyday.

Edit: Thanks for everyone for sharing their stories and just being here. It really means a lot. Brad was a real inspiration to me, he taught me English, helped me in games we played together and got me into programming which I ended up career shifting to. Tbh I can go on and on about brad and I wouldn't even come close describing how good of a man he was..."	pos
"My husband and I had a friend we played PS4 games with. After he wasn't on for a few days (he was an avid streamer on YouTube and wanted to make it big on the platform) we contacted his wife, who informed us that on the last day we played together he'd gotten off, gotten ready for bed, went to the kitchen for a snack... And had a heart attack and died right then and there. 

Every year on his birthday we still send condolences. RIP, Big Will. Please don't come back as a zombie."	pos
I met this dude on PS home. He had a mic while I had a real keyboard hooked up. The convos were semi-fluid. He let me know he was expecting a kid & was stressed about becoming a dad because he felt he wasnt ready but needed to be the man his new baby & girl deserved. It was unplanned & he didnt put much thought into his own future until she broke the news to him. Guy said he didnt have many friends & was happy to have a outlet that didnt talk down to him. Time went on & he was online a lot less around the time he said the baby would get here. My brothers eventually factory reset my PS3 & I couldnt remember my log in info to get back into the account I hope everything turned out well for him. The kid would be around 10 now.	pos
"On the off chance this gets read...  

We were feeling out comp BF. Someone recruited this dude, camo_milk. Super chill, bit of lack of patience with really chatty folks, but hey, I'm the same way, so that was fine by me. We did a bunch of practices, some scrims, but one day he just stops logging in and his discord gets de-activated. Well. That sucks. Just to make sure everything's cool, I ping a dude he invited into a public server for casual matchups. Turns out he's got stuff IRL to deal with. I tell his friend to tell him that's all good, we understand and he's welcome to show whenever.   

Offers still up, dude. Hopefully we meet again."	pos
"I haven't shared this with anyone but my SO, so here I go.

Xbox buddy I've known since around 2006, or '07. Played almost daily together for years. Last spoke mid-2020 to catch up a bit and realized just how much I missed talking to him. It was the norm for one or both of us to go offline for weeks or even months at a time then catch up next time we were both online.

A few months later, a mutual friend of ours broke the news to me. He had passed away not long after our last chat together. I was devastated. Still heartbroken about it.

Anytime I see memes like this, I think about him."	neg
"I had a really good friend I used to play Gears of War 3 with. We kept playing on 360 together even after all our friends went next gen.

His mic didn't work great, so he was always muted in party chat and we didn't use voice chat at all if it was just me and him. Funny enough, we started to pull off super clutch plays without saying a word once a few months of us being the only two left went by. We could just read each other. It was such an incredible feeling.

I left him a goodbye note when I went off to college and couldn't take my Xbox. As sad as it is to have to give up such a strong bond, it does give me piece of mind knowing that I got to say a proper farewell.

I hope he's doing alright.

I'll never forget his motto on his profile was ""it's just a game"" which cracked me up because the rest of our crew would get so salty when we lost matches. And if I've taken anything away from that relationship, it's that chill attitude. I do still get a bit salty sometimes, but generally playing side by side with him for a couple years helped cool my head. I'll be forever thankful for that."	pos

One of us is still the same nerdy guy we love and is working regularly. 

One of us was able to finally move out with her boyfriend and have some degree of freedom. 

One of us stuck out his studies and defended his doctorate thesis. 

One of us transitioned and married and is living happily and stably."	pos
"I'm going through this now.

In fact, this exact scenario. Easily someone I consider my best friend.

Late night, 66 days ago, friend came in. Says food poisoning really knocked him for a loop and thats why he hasn't been on the last few days. Says he will see me later. He was going to go take a nap. I say to get well soon and I have a game lined up for when he gets back.

20 days pass. I think nothing of it because he was saying he was going to go cross country to visit his mom and he will be sporadically on, a few days before his sickness. I figured he recovered and was just busy with that.

Turns out he liked to head out to his car and take naps to escape the world away from his cell phone. Unlock from electronics. He never woke up from his nap he went to take after getting off Discord with me. Hypoglycemia from the food poisoning. I'll never touch that game I had lined up. That was our game in my mind. The animes we watched together, too, are forever on pause. As of 66 days ago, according to Steam.

We'll catch up later. I'm sure of it."	pos

Didn't they show in Pokemon Origins that the gym leaders select their Pokemon based on the amount of badges the trainer has so it can be a fair fight for the trainer and so they can work their way up?	neg
" This is how Pokemon Crystal Clear works. It's a fan made rom of Crystal. Lets you pick your starting region, a bunch of different starters, let's you battle the gyms in any order and the gym leaders use different amounts of Pokemon based on how many badges you have.

Canon in the Pokemon Special shows that they take out specific Pokemon based on your number of badges	pos
"Gym leaders will use weaker pokemon on purpose based on your gym badge level. In black and white 2, the first gym leader is your rival from black and white 1 who literally made it to the elite four with you. He says if he was allowed to use his real team he'd whoop your ass."	neg
"i like the idea from the pokemon ova special they did that was basically the plot of the games where they showed gym leaders had several different pokemon to choose from and made their choice on which and how many based on the number of badges a trainer had.

like, yeah brock COULD whip out these level 40+ dvolved monsters to wreck your little pallet town ass, but he saw it's your first gym so you're getting a little geodude and an onyx. "	pos

Boy is this game, or at least low ranks toxic. I'd say the player base is around 16 where csgo is 20. Holy fuck though, everything is always someone else's fault and they are shouting dumb shit. 

Could be bias but I was comparing my last ten matches in csgo, the most common phrase is ""Im not playing well today"" followed by, "" it happens to us all"" oh and the n word.

There are games with communities that are more toxic than others. Rocket league is one of the more toxic ones. But it's all through text nobody uses voice chat in that game.

In the first 10 minutes of the game, a door explodes. The room is fairly big so I put a knocked out guy in the corner on the opposite end so he wouldn't die. It turns out, he died. The ONLY way for him to survive is for you to put him in a nearby container. I had no idea.

Everyone's armies are so big they are in a close race to see if they can wipe each other out before the deadline or not.

I played the game when I first met him, but quit around 10 years ago and it took me 2 weeks to use up my entire army with constant attacks on players. I can't imagine trying to do this now with 10 years of added army.

Edit: for those asking, yes the game was Evony. No I didn't know it was the same game as the ""come play with me my lord"" games, they also had ads ""build your castle, grow your army, defeat your enemy"" and my kid wanted to play it. I helped him with it but didn't see the world chat until after the tutorial, at which point I told my kid he wasn't allowed to play it.

"Guys. Flash created my childhood. From the days YouTube first came out and screamer videos took over the internet. Which was vastly unimaginably tiny. Criss angel videos along with Davis blaine parody videos. Then the david blaine Vs Criss angel little YouTube series that I watched over and over again. Waiting for my parents to go to bed before I hopped on 666games . net which was my first bit of gore in a game and I loved it. Those puzzle games as well that had screamers placed in every now and then. 

The scary maze game craze! Man that's my childhood. Happy wheels. AGE OF WAR! Watching uberhaxornova when he first started out and I came home from school every day wanting to watch his series. Things were so much simpler I feel like bawling my eyes out. I really want to go back in time back to them days. It made me who i was in high school. I say this because the internet now has turned me into not such a good person.

Most of my feelings are mute, yet I reminisce about the past and want to go back. Whatever I see on the web now I just am not really bothered. I don't know if anyone else feels the same way. I miss the old font of YouTube. Seeing broadcast yourself right beneath it is my childhood... I feel like throwing away flash is throwing away a piece of me. I know YouTube isn't related to this but the whole intent of the internet now is for everyone to make money..

The guys who made videos and games for us kids did it because they loved it and they genuinely didn't care about anything else. People can say this now but the motive and incentive for money wasn't really a thing back then if I'm being honest. Times have changed and I miss the hell out of it so much. 

I miss talking to people on the internet where they actually want to communicate with you, little chat boxes and having fun conversations with respectful people. Now it's kids yelling down the mic disrespecting their parents. Teenagers talking about you getting cancer and them fucking your mum and dad. Yes horrible I know..but back then it was ""how was your day mate!! Ready for some kongregate?"" 

I can't remember half the games on there but if I was to head back there I would be in a paradise of my past. God please bring them times back :(  there's so much more I can talk about but you guys catch my drift. Rest in peace flash.."	pos

He bought an Atari when my mom was pregnant with me, so I grew up playing that with him,  but when newer gaming systems came along,  he just watched us play and stuck with his Atari.

With the original Playstation, we had a game called ESPN Xtreme Games, where you raced on bikes, lunges, rollerblades, etc. My brother subbed I loved it and begged Dad to try it and he always said he'd rather watch us.
Until he gave in. He said he'd give it a shot and race me. He *wiped the floor with me*. He hit all the bonuses and tore it up. When we told our mom, she just laughed.  ""Of course he did! You really think he doesn't play when you're not there?""

"I've been thinking about my Mimi a lot recently. When I was a kid, she would always encourage my love for video games. Super Mario Bros 3 was our go to to play together, and I always wanted to be Luigi because green was my favorite color, so she would get hit by a goomba straight away so I could beat the first level. She absolutely adored Sonic the Hedgehog when it first came out, and bought a Sega Genesis for herself with every sonic game. When I did my first deployment, she promised me that she would be better than me at any sonic game when I came back (she was in her 80s), so the first day I was home, I went to see her. She didn't know I was back yet, and she was halfway through the second part of Metropolis zone when I showed up. She got up, hugged me til sonic died from a time out, reset the sega, gave me a controller, and said ""Let's go, Tails"". We played for hours, just laughing and having a good time. I miss it. 

She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's by the next time I came home. My mom said towards the end she would shoo nurses away from her TV because they were gonna take her Sega away. She'd always point at my pictures and say she had to wait until I got home so we could play another few games before she would let go. She passed two days before my vacation started two years ago. She would be 96 this December 21st. 

Thank you for posting this, OP. I hope our Grandmas are gaming together."	pos

In my area, we've got a place with a couple locations now that has tons of cheap used games and consoles, plus some hard to find editions and a section for non-video gaming. They're pretty solid.  

Unfortunately, the best place around closed recently, likely due to their prices.  Tons of sweet older games for $5 a pop, and any old sports games they got in they sold for $2.  I picked up like a half a dozen NBA, WWE, NASCAR, NHL, MLB and FIFA games for $10. The store never looked like anything special, just some old mismatched shelving and an ancient cash register, but man did the guys running that place know their stuff. They'd have conversations with customers about literally anything to do with video games. They knew what came out in Japan last month, they'd know the differences in editions for obscure games, they'd give people a dozen game recommendations based on what they were bringing to the counter.  I can only hope they caught on somewhere else because they may have been the most knowledgeable salespeople I ever came across."	pos

Finally they get bought out by another local chain that is basically indie GameStop. They stop paying cash for trades, start selling new and taking preorders and then jack everything up to eBay prices and above on retro.

"Wanna hear a similarly crazy story about Oaks shows and my father:

My dad went a couple years ago for Ss and Gs, and went to one of the gun shows just to look around.

He stumbled upon a hunting rifle that looked super familiar. He asked the dealer to hold it and was explaining the back story to him as he looked it over:

Decades before this, my dad used to hunt with a friend and bought a rifle exactly like this, and sold it to his friend when he was done hunting as a hobby. His friend sold it to someone else and he never saw it again.

My dad said he fell exactly one time while hunting with that rifle, and scratched the scope and the stock in a very specific way, but that those scratches were never repaired and were only cosmetic. 

My dad said, if he flips this gun and finds these scratches, he has to buy this rifle since it is the one he owned.

The vendor said if it is his, he will give him a large discount because the story was incredible.

He is the proud owner of his own rifle.  Lol.  Got like 20% off because the vendor was so awesome."	pos

"Not at all suprised... My dad worked at PopCap during the time just prior to its acquisition by EA. The company was completely gutted essentially. Popcap legitimately LOVED making their games. They truly wanted to foster positive fun gaming experience without the bullshit. Striving for accessibility for anyone was a huge core value. It was incredibly sad to see the layoffs happen (including my dad) and to see the games morph into a way to separate people from their money.. Every time I got to go into the Seattle office before EA, I felt welcomed by atmosphere. IDK about how it is now but I'd bet its not nearly as fun.."	pos
"Well, let's see. I've replayed PvZ more times than I can remember. (At least 20 times, seriously). Every achievement. Every secret. I have some really high score on endless and on vase breaker...I've played the hell out of this game.

I got my first copy in a POPCAP game package I downloaded from a torrent site (yep, my very first copy was a pirated copy). Didn't play the game forever...Didn't know it existed. One day I accidentally came across it and was hooked! Never played a game this fun yet this simple. Graphics...sounds...gameplay...controls. All were top notch.

I enjoyed the game so much that I bought it from PopCap. (I'm not an asshole. If I play a game and like it, I buy it.) But it didn't end there.  
When it went on sale on the AppStore, I got it for my iPad.  
When it went on sale on the Play Store, I bought it from there, too. Why both? Because I dislike Apple and will never buy another Apple OS based device again.  
THEN, eventually, they released the deluxe version on Steam...so I got that because I'd rather play on there than my phone.

**I bought this game fucking 4 times....3 different platforms. Because the game was THAT good.** And this is what devs need to understand. You make a solid game, let the masses be your advertisers and the game WILL sell itself.

I cleared PvZ2 one time when it first came out and haven't touched the game since. Didn't buy a single IAP. I may have given the game another shot later on after a bunch of content had been released, but when I opened their store and went ""Oh, only 100 some bucks to unlock everything..."", I got discouraged from even wanting to play. I can't 100% the game without spending a shit ton of money. So I have no desire to even attempt.

I'd say EA is sticking to their normal par for ruining fantastic franchises.

Edit: Spelling and grammar.  
Edit 2: I bought the game 4 times, not 3 times. Had to go confirm."	pos

"This happened to me in real life on my 18th birthday....it suuucks. I almost died. I didnt see it coming I was just standing under a palm tree that was about 3-4 stories high. 
Thought someone had shot me, saw a huge flash, felt like I was an inch tall and growing back to my normal height while spinning in a washing machine. Once it stopped I saw that My friend who I was taking to had a look of horror on his face, as a black blob went flying past him, as blood filled my eyeballs and a few chunks of random teeth fell out of my mouth. Was so strange everything was in slow motion and happening all at once at the same time. 
Incredibly, it didnt knock me out. But it drove the little button on the top of the ball cap I was wearing right down to bone and split my noggin open. As I was thinking wtf just happened I heard my friend say bounced off of your fucking head!, and I was thinking what did? I was suddenly laying down. Seeing people all around me. Then I was put into a drug coma. That was freaky weird cuz I was notout. But was still thinking and hearing things going on, and still having dreams despite it and the fact my brain had swollen up really bad. All the dreams I had were super vivid and felt so real. 
I could tell I was fucked up, but strangely my mind still worked and was still fully aware. Time was just really strange, passing all at once while also dribbling by.... I remember having a dream about having to take a shit really bad and so I was going to do it in an airplane, but the toilet was in the middle of the plane like a normal seat. And right as I sat down to take a shit passengers all started coming on the plane and so I quickly wipe my butt with my finger while yanking my pants up at the same time, smearing a little bean of Shit on my pants and was thinking how everybody was gonna smell that finger print of shit for the whole plane ride... which flew into outer space and across the galaxy haha.

"The worst thing is that they made you walk beside the NPC without holding the controller in AC Revelations. It's a step backward. A *slow* step backward.

Edit: oh, damn, thought it was AC Odissey, not Dragon Age."	neg

"Odyssey doesn't have a ""walk"" speed. It's analog based on how much you're pressing the stick. "	neg
May be a bug. After 100 hours in AC Odyssey all escort quests has the NPC running and you're forced to slow down if you're about to pass em.	neg
"From the dev point of view (assuming npc speed will never change to match you or whatever):

If npc is slower than walk, it takes forever and you have to walk and stop anyway.

If equals walk, still slow, and since you can't follow their path identically, you would still have to sprint on and off.

If between walk and sprint, you sprint, walk, sprint, walk, which isn't perfect, but you're not wasting time not moving. And you're not getting lost

If equals sprint speed, same problem as if equals walking speed, but you couldn't catch up.

If faster than sprint then you can't keep up.

The fastest, least annoying option is faster than walk and slower than sprint.

Edit: Again, I'm not saying constant speed for the npc is the best option. Its definitely not. I am saying given that constant npc speed is what's being used, and you HAVE to choose a speed, that's the best speed."	pos
"Didn't in Revelations you could just press a button and be able to walk along an NPC without even touching your controller?
"	neg
"If they are as fast as your run you wouldn't be able to catch up if you fell behind,  If they moved as slow as your walk it would take much longer.
I think escort quests are bad too but making it take longer or having to npc sprint off on you both sound like bad solutions "	neg
"If the NPC was always your walking speed, they'd be extremely slow. If they're always your running speed, you can never catch up to them if you make a slight deviation from their route."	neg
Shoutout to the witcher for making the npc travel at your speed. Full horse sprint is unmatched to the blazing fast npc run	neg
"I can kind of understand it. If they walked your your walk speed it would be too slow but if they sprinted, it would be easier for a player to lose track of the npc. There are obviously ways to avoid this like just having your walk speed be faster, or some sort of auto follow but a lot of devs just dont put any thought into it"	pos
They move faster than your walking speed so it doesn't take forever. And they're slower than your running speed so you can catch up if you fall behind for whatever reason. It's the most logical thing to do for any NPC that's supposed to walk on their own and not just follow you	neg
"I'm playing through The Witcher 3 right now and I greatly appreciate their NPC speeds: it's whatever speed you're doing. You walk, they walk. You jog, they jog. It feels so nice."	pos

"One of the greatest moments of my life was in 5th grade when I legit beat Mike Tyson in Punch Out. I had been working on it for two years, and when I told all of my friends that I had finally done it they did not believe me.

â

So, I invited everyone over and of course word got around and I had over 20 people in my house huddled around a 20 inch TV trying to show everyone I did it.

â

Because I was nervous it took me a couple of tries, but on the third try I knocked that son of a gun down with three seconds left in the third round....KO baby! 

â

If you have ever done it you know it is really really hard to get a TKO on Tyson, because it requires three knock downs in one round. Anyway, when it was accomplished everybody cheered and jumped up and danced and congratulated me as if I had literally beat the real Mike Tyson.

â

I was famous for about a week at school....I kid you not....and it was awesome!

Again, I did that when I was in 5th grade. Now that I am old and have a Nintendo classic...I can't get the bastard past the second round. LOL :D

"Hey, you reposted my replay that I posted on /r/BladeAndSorcery !

My main goal in posting that replay was to get other people into this game, because it's given me a LOT of joy, and I'm seeing a lot of people saying they want to buy this game now, so I wanted to share my settings that I use.

It's really easy to have a frustrating first experience with Blade and Sorcery, because the physics intentionally slow you down so that the weapons feel like they have weight. **But it is SO SO SO worth getting over that hump, learning the 'style' of the physics so you can do fun ninja shit.**

Here's what you need to know based on how I run the game:

â

1. Blade & Sorcery with

**""The Outer Rim"" mod:**  [https://www.nexusmods.com/bladeandsorcery/mods/528](https://www.nexusmods.com/bladeandsorcery/mods/528)

This is the mod that gives you Star Wars lightsabers and blasters.

(Put this mod in your ""StreamingAssets folder"")

2)

**""Dark Chains"" mod** \- this enables you to grip enemies and move them with telekinesis (not shown in this replay)

(Put this mod in your ""StreamingAssets folder"")

[https://www.nexusmods.com/bladeandsorcery/mods/583](https://www.nexusmods.com/bladeandsorcery/mods/583)

â

3) I always recommend going into your in-game settings in the book and changing the following:

**PlayerInvincibility = True**

**Mana = 9999** (this enables you to do infinite slow-mo)

Going into the ""Handling"" settings and turn both PositionDamper settings into 0.50 (this enables you to move a little more freely while still feeling the weight of the weapons)

4) **I almost always play with Slo-Mo on and speed my replays up in post.** I kind of use this game as a ""Cool Replay Generator Machine"" - that's how I have fun with it. It depends on which system you have, but on the Valve Index and Oculus Rift S, slow-mo is the top  face button on the right controller (think ""Y"" on an Xbox controller)

4)

**I really really recommend doing this last step even though it takes a bit of effort.**

â

There's currently a glitch in Blade & Sorcery which causes enemy waves to spawn all at once, so you're fighitng like 12 guys at once (rather than them spawning over time). The solution that I've found for that, when fighting Jedi, is this.

Go into your StreamingAssets folder and open The Outer Rim mod. Go into ""Waves"" and change your ""JediAmbush"" settings in Notepad to this:

                ""conditionThreshold"": 0
            }
        ]
    }

This means you'll only ever face 3 enemies at once, and the wave will loop infinitely.

To give an example everytime the main characters give the so called ""speech"" which by the way is so dull that you have to wonder if the speech is actually for warriors or  5th grade students, so every time there is a speech, their village is attacked.

"This reminds me of a sad story.

A friend of mine wanted to get into PC gaming and wanted a high end PC but didn't want to deal with building it himself. I think he wanted some Sony PC, I don't recall. This was pre-Alienware, and he wanted some name brand PC so it had tech support if he needed it.

Anyway, he started saving all of extra money, he was working two jobs at the time, so that helped. It wasn't long before he neared his goal. 

It was around this time, however, that his girlfriend at the time decided to stop paying her share of the rent and other bills. He was forced to tap into his PC fund to make ends meet. This went on for months, until she finally surprised him with what she had been spending her money on.

Turns out that she had been saving up to get them two tickets on a cruise ship for their anniversary. Which I'm sure he would have loved, if it wasn't for the fact that couldn't swim, that he hated the ocean, and hated cruise ships.  She was happy through. 

Anyway, he was able to use the last of his saving to by a GBA SP. Which he showed our friends and I exclaiming it to be the PC he had been saving for all this time."	pos

1. Light attack, push, killing move: the killing move is so goddamn slow compared to other characters. He literally lifts his tiny dagger in the air for 3 seconds before stabbing down. More often than not you'll get attacked during that and your combo will be interrupted.
2. Light attack, push, heavy attack: again, the last movement somehow is longer than other characters, so the hit almost always never connects as the enemy has already fallen to the ground after the push."	neg

edit: done downloading. gonna try it out.

edit 2: just finished tutorial. controls are CLEAN. using keyboard even though they recommend a gamepad, i dont have one. =-(

edit 3: just finished first game in campaign. things i liked: style, art, sound effects, realism.

things i didn't like: 1. long intro where the dude is just walking for a long time in silence at the beginning of the campaign could use some music or something.

 2. i wish there was more tutorial on parrying. like maybe make sure the player can complete 3 high, 3 mid, and 3 low parries before throwing him into the game so he can learn what those moves look like and know which stance to parry from.

 3. i didn't like how in the campaign when i took a path, i could only move forward on that path, unable to try out some of the other directions originally offered.. this made the difficulty ramp up VERY fast as well as make me feel like i'm missing out on  whatever items were the other direction. I guess if that's what you're going for, realism and all, that the dude can't just hop around the map, i get it, but maybe a warning at the start would be nice. 

4. You only need to say that the game works best with a controller once, maybe twice. i must have read 4 or 5 times that the game works best with a controller. by the third time, i was thinking, ' I get it!' 

Summary: I like it and i'm eager to play it again. everything i said here is given in the sense of constructive criticism, only hoping it will make your game better. best of luck, and good on you for following your dreams, man."	pos

"This is called regulation. People will say that regulation is bad because it stifles the industry. They'll say the best policy is a free market. They are wrong. A free market is literally an anarchy of economics. We have regulation to protect people from the many things in the world that are more powerful than an individual, like massive corporations. To say that regulation is bad because it stifles the industry is like saying condoms are bad because you don't get to come inside your partner. That's the fucking point, the industry is abusing and or exploiting people with it's power and needs to be stifled because if that's the only way to keep it ethical then that's the only way to do it. If we could trust corporations not to be immoral at every single opportunity the situation would be different, but instead we can trust that corporations will always be immoral every time in every industry, and so we must rely on regulation. Anything less is flagrantly unethical.

EDIT: I'm just going to pre-empt the people who keep coming in to say ""It's the parents job!"" no shit sherlock, this wouldn't be a problem if marketing didn't work, but it does, and the parents aren't doing their job. So let me ask you this: So what do we do about that? Microtransactions have had a well documented and well understood negative effect on the whole industry, and it's a problem that needs to be solved, and the right comes in with, ""the people who are at fault should solve it"" because the people who are at fault obviously are just going to come around overnight, right? That's not going to work. I don't care whose fault it is, what you're saying is we should rely on the market to self-regulate, and news flash, after decades, *it hasn't, and it won't.* So basically if you're coming in here whining about the parents, you have no solution to the problem, shush.

And to pre-empt the people who are flipping out because government can't be trusted to do anything, is this at like how they banned ciggie ads everywhere to protect children like decades ago and it immediately opened the floodgates to the government having total control over free speech? Oh right, that didn't happen, instead the people who buy smokes weren't affected, children were a little safer from the literal mind-control attempt that marketing always is, and only big corporations were negatively affected, and despite not being able to advertise they're still doing just fine. How is it that the stance that the government is always unethical, always corrupt, and always incompetent 100% of the time isn't an extreme viewpoint? It is. The government is usually corrupt nowadays due to corporate takeover of it, so along comes a law that works directly against corporate power, and we still can't do it because the government isn't allowed to do anything and shouldn't exist or whatever? This is just anarchy with extra bitching."	neg
I'm surprised to see anyone defending the gaming companies. Surely we all would enjoy games the way they used to be right? With the whole game accessible for the cost of the game and only expansion packs costing extra?	pos
"Imo.

F2P Games with Microtransactions? They should be unaffected in most cases, especially as long as it's only cosmetics.

P2P Games with them? Generally not a fan, but as long as it's only cosmetic and not content, and or the content could also be unlocked via progression/in-game currency, then go ahead.

Lootboxes/Crates/Cases as a game mechanic? Fine, literally no harm comes from them in regards to obtaining items. Especially if there are also extra alternatives to getting items.

â

Full removal of Microtransactions is not what we need, at least for games that rely on it as their only income.

Regulation (Which digitally is more or less impossible) on who can buy stuff is a hopeful thought, but seems like it would never work since ""Age-Gates"" have proven to more or less never work, and I doubt

â

The core issue though with kids ""buying so many cosmetics"", or ""racking up bills"", etc. stem from parents letting them use their cards. Yes, the games shouldn't prey on making you have to buy shit, or feel like if you don't buy it, you're out of luck, but it still falls upon the parents who don't keep an eye or lock on what their children do. It's also not like every kid using their parents money are exactly ""wasting"" it on unboxing 24/7, etc. here's a bunch of people who do it in moderation which is fine imo.

â

The issue with the current loot-box system is that it specifically preys on whales and those who have gambling issues.

I'd like to see games go back to when game-play and content wasn't locked behind Battle Passes, and DLC, but that seems unlikely"	pos

"Me, my wife, and my brother in law used to play Left 4 Dead 2 together every night for hours when it first came out, and we were always being matched with a random fourth player for our team. 

This one night we end up getting matched with a 10 or 11 year old boy who is just plain obnoxious. He's telling us stories about how he was about to kill Hitler with a headshot but Hitler beat him to it, and about how one time he ate so much ice cream that he passed out and woke up the next day naked on his front lawn. He's taking potshots at us while we're doing stuff. He's cracking jokes constantly. He's blocking us from objectives.

Eventually we got fed up, thinking he was a run of the mill troll, so we gunned him down mercilessly while talking smack and vote kicked him out. He kept rejoining, and we'd keep kicking him out again. After about 4 times, he had a brief enough window to sheepishly say ""Please don't kick me again guys; everyone always kicks me out. I just want someone to play with."" Our hearts broke right there - we all felt absolutely terrible.

We kept him in our party for the rest of the night, and it was honestly one of the best decisions we ever made (at least for my wife and I). We ended up becoming really good online friends with him, his mom, and some of his family. They even came to meet us once in real life when they were vacationing near our area a few years ago."	pos

Buy the deluxe edition for what, $20-30 more than the standard? and then you dont buy those extra things ever again because theyre...*included*. I dont like EA anymore than the next guy but I dont think this is fair criticism here. They gave us what we wanted.

I am a little fan-made bot who loves /u/SrGrafo but is a little lazy with hunting for EDITs. If you want to support our great creator, check out his [Patreon](https://Patreon.com/SrGrafo)"	pos

"Ironically, Zelda and Link are based off High Elves or Noble Elves which again have the whole Aryan look going on. Explains why they are majestic and divine and everyone else is garbage.

Certain Japanese industry and people are infatuated with the whole Aryan look for some reason. It is pretty creepy."	pos
Mario would like a word.	pos
The crazy hair lets you know who the main character is!	neg
"I love your comics, but I can't help but **wonder**; why is there almost always at least one **word** highlighted with a different color in each bubble, even if there's not **really** particular significance to it?"	neg
Pay extra 60$ to see a character	neg
Wait. Am I a non-main character in zelda?	neg
"I liked the npc designs in Botw, but they looked pretty bad in Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword"	pos
So this guy does comics of usernames? Is it like a template of a bunch of reactions and he/she ads the names? Or do you come up with jokes about them based on the name and draw a new comic?	pos
ngl elf man in the zelda games was always oh-so hot. his big ass nose taunting me and my dick mmm	neg
Tingle is a main character at this point.	neg
How bout Sidon? Hes hot af	neg
That's actually pretty cool and I bet would make the game super engrossing	pos
"Upvoted for Makoto's theme, song is fire."	neg
This is sick! Dark Souls on its own is hard enough but just imagine me (lazy af) trying this and i would be destroyed by the first enemy lol	neg
is this real or he just photoshopping it. this looks fake af by the way his cam is setup	neg
The next step is just to finish the game irl	neg
Bet hed like Rise of Nightmares	pos
You cheeky bastard... Get it boi!!! Dark souls is rough af. You paired that bish with exercising? Holy fuck mate it's not longer arm chair sweats ... Again you cheeky bastard. I love this.	neg
Ringfit kicks my ass in like 10 minutes game is fire	neg
"Enter PVP, kill the guy, teabag IRL to heal"	neg
Do this wrong and the words 'You died' will appear irl.	neg
There should be a reality TV show based on Florida	neg
"Native Floridian that has since moved; I guarantee most people from Florida have videos of lights taking way too long. It just happens so often. It doesnt help much that most drivers there are slow, its hot af, and there are always a decent amount of tourists. Sandy buttcheeks on hot tar leather waiting for all these long ass lights and traffic down Flagler is a tale as old as time."	neg
"Whenever something like this happens I call the citys traffic light department and explain what is going on. They usually fix the problem the same day. At the end of my street we had a light that would stay green for literally 3 seconds. Called to complain, now it stays green for 10-15 seconds. Same with a pedestrian button that was stuck and kept the opposite light on green for an extra 30 seconds.

You gotta call that shit in. They wont know unless you tell them. 


That being said, we desperately need to revamp the whole traffic system in the entire US. I read somewhere that we could even reduce co2 levels by a lot if we calibrate the system and put mathematicians in charge of redesigning it."	neg
"You could have just said Florida tbh. As someone from there, I expect nothing less."	neg
"That lame excuse about the old, cartoonish style of the old games is pure BS.

No one was complaining that the characters looked to unreal, they're complaining that they have LESS detail than the originals.

And that line about wanting to ""preserve the authentic experience"", that would have been better done by not delisting all the original versions, essentially scrubing them from existence...

Edit: and just to add, data mining has pretty much confirmed that these ""definitive"" copies of the games are all based off of the mobile ports. Fuck R*."	neg

Are you the same guy that did the DarkSouls (I believed it was this game) KOd a few months ago? This is awesome. I bet the Kinect Engineering team is wondering What If? Lol.	pos

"Wow, that is soo cool, but Mario Jumps a LOT! I bet this must be a ridiculous workout If you play for a few hours at a time"	pos
"""Available at a later date"" really scares me still. Turning off the micro transactions is great but what happens when everyone picks up the game and they come right back? After all the shady things that have happened, how can people honestly trust a word that's said about this game anymore? I'll keep an eye on this but i won't pick it up until i hear what happens with in-game purchases. "	pos
"""Ability to purchase crystals in-game will be implemented at a later date.""

So they're still going to fuck the player, just after everyone buys the game? I don't know guys. I wouldn't trust them as far as I can throw them. I'm still not dropping any money on this.

Edit: I think my only condition would be if these packs were for cosmetic items only. Heros, weapons, and perks should all be available through a progression system based on gameplay only. If the devs want extra cash for cool hero costumes, trooper costumes, weapon camos, or emotes, I wouldn't object to that at all. From one game dev to another, I get that $60 isn't much for a full featured game anymore. The price of games hasn't gone up in years. I understand standards are higher, but the price is the same. That being said, even an amateur dev such as myself can clearly see putting any gameplay changing elements behind a random loot box style pay wall is just awful for balancing. The COD4 remaster did this, and half the loot box buying idiots run around with horribly overpowered weapons that the devs added in. It killed the gameplay for me. It no longer felt like the original Modern Warfare. If you guys do this, you'll kill the core gameplay. I just don't trust EA at all. The devs are still stuck under contract from these publishers too, so while I can sympathize, they're still caught up in the scam too.

Edit 2: I totally get purchasing map packs though. That doesn't effect gameplay too much.

Edit 3: Thanks for the gold stranger. Just speaking my mind. Current practices aren't cool, and that's why I chose this career path. Follow me on Twitter @UnleadedPetro for student gamedev stuff and occasional shit posts. I always like seeing other people's game development projects for inspiration. I also am shilling for myself right now a bit. Carry on. "	neg
"The moral quandary i have with this game is that my 10 year old autistic son REALLY REALLY wants this game. He's been badgering me about it pretty much every day since it was announced and turned up on the xbox store as a preorder asking me how many days until its out. I had originally said he can ask for it for Christmas and had no problem with buying it until this last week, i was always going to wait for it to go on EA access for me and my game sharing buddy as we aren't really bothered about it.

Now i know he doesn't give two shits or understands about EA and their shady practices. He wont be able to see the bigger picture and wont see anything wrong with the poor casuals who cant put hundreds of hours into the game like he undoubtedly will over the next year or so. 

Which kind of makes me one of these dumb parents buying it for their whining kids who love Star Wars but what do i do? Become the worst dad ever and disappoint him on Christmas day because we all need to hit EA where it hurts or do i fold and become part of the problem?

I pretty much know the answer btw... sorry guys... but if that little shit thinks i'm buying him some crystals then he's gonna be disappointed.. That's the line i wont cross!"	neg
"man, they really don't want to let skyrim die huh?...I was in high school when it first came out and now I have been graduated from college for a year now and I still see mentions of skyrim...and still having presentations about it all these years later. Sheesh..."	neg

"Everyone I have spoken to about ESO, who wasn't just some sceney-weenie who was a WOW/LOL ""nerd"" that just obviously didn't know anything about any other video games and had a macbook that their mom/grandmother got them for christmas one year, has said the game was just another MMO unlike what B-thez said they were going to do. My girls father was actually an Alpha tester and he said that it started off the way they said it was going to, and then something must've gone terribly wrong...did someone important or in charge die? RIP original ESO idea. "	neg
"You pick three characters, if one of them is Saitama (the one punch guy) then you can only use 2 characters, while Saitama is on a timer to get to the battlefield. By stalling and doing parries you buy yourself time until he arrives, at which point you win, unless the match time runs out.

Saitama cannot be damaged (unless it's by another Saitama) but he is pretty slow.

Edit: There is also a dream version of Saitama, that is balanced like the other characters. It's based on the dream Saitama had, where he was weak and actually able to feel excitement in his life by fighting on equal footing."	pos
it totally looks photoshopped tbh	neg

"Ummm, i get lense flare effects in my vision irl..."	pos
"OP is confusing realism with aesthetics. Videogames use visual language based on cinema, and cinema's language is in turn limited by a camera.

Your eyeballs may not be a camera, but there's also a ton of stuff emulating real eyes would be detrimental to the look of the game:

Would you rather have some droplets strategically places on your screen to simulate rain hitting your view, or having your characters squinting and brushing their eyes because they can't see? Yeah, you don't get that sort of lens flares either... but you also don't go blind when you have the sun at a mildly inconvenient angle. What's that? Your character is running against the wind without eye protection? See the droplet argument again. The list would go on...

There's things games that cna enhance immersion, but not everything that is *realistic* is necessarily *better* for it. It sounds cool to navigate the swamps of Africa as Spec Ops soldiers... but 99% of gamers wouldn't like even the visual inconvenience of doing it realistically.

There's a balance to strike, between artistic depictions, authenticity and realism. At the end of the day, the rule of fun wins."	pos
"Okay, someone explain to me how do you find a DS (any version) comfortable to play with? I'm a small guy alright? I'm 5'1"", so I have small hands, and I can't even get comfortable with a 3DS XL.

"When I was a younger person I worked at this small mom and pops diner. One day, a young suit came into to eat, they were pleasant, talkative, and inquisitive. They studied the menu for a while, ordered their food, ate. And when they got up to pay, they asked to see the owner/cook. When the owner came out they complimented the meal, thank him for the food, and then served him a cease and desist order. The diner served a child's pancake in the shape of mickey mouse's head. The paperwork threatened to sue them for well more than the business was worth. True story. In Disney's defense, the diner did call it a 'mickey pancake,' in the diner's defense, fuck Disney."	pos

I was grounded for a long time and couldnt play my 3DS so I decided to make one out of duct tape (this was during the whole duct tape craze mind you), I even made a few duct tape game cartridges to go with it. It was pretty sad, I dont remember why I got grounded in the first place but I used to get in trouble all the time when I was younger for seemingly nothing, my mom gets angry easily and plays the victim card while bullying others and my dad was easily angered too. Nowadays since Im older and can defend myself my dad is a lot more passive but my mom still gets angry over tiny things and you cant say a single word to her or contradict her without her blowing up and taking it personally and says stuff like no one cares what I have to say and I dont get any respect"	neg
"I still remember when I got my very first computer and I could finally join my groups LAN parties. It was a 900MHz CPU / 20GB HD eMachines. My friends figured out my video card couldnt process smoke grenades in CS, so they would only buy smoke grenades and throw them at me until my game crashed immediately to desktop. 

Those were the best days.

Edit: Haha Im really glad this resonated with folks. Equal parts My first gaming PC was even sadder! And I didnt know they made gaming PCs that sad! Definitely grew up playing Wolfenstein on floppies on my dads PC. The eMachines was the first computer I ever personally owned. It shit the bed permanently at another lab party when I installed so many games my HD would fluctuate showing between 0 and 8 Mb free space available! RIP"	pos

They should just sell their video game licenses tbh and focus on their pachinko machines lmao	pos
"Konami's problem with Hideo Kojima was that his games were extremely costly to produce.  Don't get me wrong, I love Metal Gear Solid and I think that is a series that is almost as iconic as Final Fantasy or Zelda, but the fanbase is much less than those franchises.  So you are spending as much for the production of the new Metal Gear Solid game as they are for the new Mario game, but 4X as many people are going to buy the Mario game?  In business that doesn't fly.  I love Hideo Kojima as an artist but sometimes artistic investments fail.  Konami was right in a busines sense to fire him.  I am looking forward to Death Stranding because Sony apearantly has no problem giving a preposterous ammount of money to a game writer/ director based solely on name reconition.  I hope the best for him but I hope he doesn't take it too far."	pos

The sheer amount of inconsistency in the experience made it unplayable for me and I felt like all it would have taken was a system sorta like what TF2 does (XP based on wins, and for doing certain good moves within a round, players are matched by XP-range).

"Long read, TLDR at the bottom.
 
---

First, kids don't have a concept of money, how much or how little things cost.  It's not that they don't understand the numbers -- it's that they don't understand that 500 of something means they have less elsewhere.  Oh, it's $500?  Ok, that seems like a big number, but $700 isn't that much bigger.  So as a parent, you are in this balancing act of teaching kids the value of the dollar in the larger respect of an instant-gratification, instant-mediafication economy.  YouTube stars, Twitch streamers, and other social platform ""influencers"" have for years targeted that generation, and have the disposable income to pay for the latest, the coolest, and build hype around it.  These same people are the folks that casually have 10,000sq ft homes, buy Lamborghini's for their friends, and buy vehicles for their significant others for Christmas.  At some point, this lifestyle pervades into expectation for the child.  ""That's just how it is,"" rather than questioning where all the money came from or what it means to have a paycheck.

There's a reason FortNite is known for ten-year olds -- the streamers, and consequently the advertisers and their money, are targeting that demographic because they can ask mom and dad for $5-20 a week to spend on skins.  When their favorite streamer is advocating and extolling the greatness of their new, shiny console and how it makes them SO GUD, and that's why they never lose, the kids are entranced.  With the holiday coming and Santa's ability to just manufacture toys on request, you enter into a weird feedback loop why scalpers can charge the money and get it.  Parents are willing to shell out amounts of cash to their kids for allowance or whatever, and you enter into this style of media where if the kid doesn't have the latest and greatest you feel as if you are unable to deliver the childhood you wanted, and that they deserve (because we all want to make our kids' lives better than our own).  At the same time, the ideal, responsible and well-adjusted parent from The Disney Channel or Full House can put their hands on their hips, cock their head sideways and tell their kiddo that a console is a lot of money, and the kid instantly understands and accepts that.  I mean, that's obviously what the kids from any sitcom from your childhood did when they were told no from an adult, right?

Secondarily, while yes, the market and willingness to pay is part of the scalping problem, the artificial scarcity and economy drivers behind the retailers don't inhibit this practice.  If you are SONY, and your latest console is consistently selling out immediately as fast as you can make them and ship them, why would you ever increase the difficulty of selling them?  If you're Best Buy, or Fry's, or Newegg, why would you decrease your revenue ... ever?  There's no cause on either end of the spectrum to draw down the conclusion other than:

1)  The consoles are priced under their perceived value.  If their MSRP was higher, it would reach a point where it stopped selling immediately and the scalping market would diminish as profits diminish.

2)  Retailers lay very little stock in customer loyalty.  Their primary success metric is revenue.  As such, there's no impetus to limit or inhibit bot buying and re-selling.  To the retailer, they are meeting or exceeding their performance metrics.

3)  Manufacturers and supply chains are not willing or able to scale effectively as demand spikes and then diminishes.  This is a known problem in supply-side economies of scale -- see 2020 and toilet paper.  Re-tooling costs, effective or efficient labor, and the measures of success are looking for long-term growth strategies rather than playing off of short-term spikes in performance.  This is a function of the stock market analysis looking for those long-term ""blue-chip"" performers and marking them as successful rather than targeting short-term investments and driving revenue and profit centers.  If I own a logistics provider and I am given the choice of moving 10million units for the next three months and then having to lay off or downsize versus moving 1million units and keeping my workforce and capital costs even and predictable, I'm choosing the latter for a wide variety of reasons.  (Risk, media perception, and long-term investor potential)

4)  People have been doing this shit for years with ethereal goods.  If you've ever wondered why companies pay premium for real-estate in close proximity to the NYSE or the Chicago Merc (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), it's to minimize data latency so they can execute HVT, or High-Volume Trading.  When you want to sell stock in your 401k, a computer sees that order and tries to find someone offering higher than your selling price.  They then execute a man-in-the-middle trade by buying your stock at your selling price, and selling it at the other buying price.  While they might make fractions of a penny per stock exchange, by doing this millions of times per day, it quickly adds up to the potential for millions of dollars in trade profit per year.  Milliseconds are no longer the standard.  Nanoseconds are.  Now that bots are buying up PHYSICAL goods (before consoles it was fitness equipment, graphics cards, and sneakers) people are up in arms because they have mistaken that this is novel.  Middlemen have existed for years doing this with automation.

TLDR;  Ultimately, it's not about ""IF PEOPLE DIDN'T PAY SCALPERS WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS SHIT"".  There's a lot of complicated reasons I've just touched on that drive the artificial scarcity we are seeing, and it's going to make for some interesting research for years to come."	pos

I declined the offer.  That game turned out to be Myth, which was a big hit for Bungie software.  (You know, Bungie --- who now publishes HALO and Destiny!)  I could've gotten in on the ground floor! Maybe I would've been the guy who ended up doing those soundtracks, and raking in the big dollars.  Maybe not.

I tried replaying it but it wasn't the same. Even when I came across someone, they didn't seem interested in sticking together (or in sticking around, some would disconnect).

"This reminds me of a treasured memory I have.

Way back in 2006 or 7 or 8 whenever TBC launched, I started playing wow. The problem was all my friends were max level and I just started. So I was playing mostly by myself. I was clueless I had no idea what I was doing. Then a troll named Yujanda came along and helped me out. I was fully broken and lost I had wandered out of the orc starting zone to early and was stuck in the town just south of Org.

He gave me money to fix my gear and a little extra and escorted me back to where I was supposed to be. He was level 9 or 10ish and I was at the time 3 or 4. It was over a decade ago the specifics are a bit fuzzy.

But anyway he showed me the right quest path for the rest of the night and a chunk of the next day. Till I caught up with him. Then he spent the next week or so leveling with me. I will never forget how excited I was to try the rage fire caverns. He talked it up a lot and it sounded super fun. At this point we had become as good of friends as you could be in a week and some change and he told me that he had cancer and he had no idea if he would beat it. As someone who never dealt with this kind of thing it didnt really click with me the gravity of the situation. Even at 14 or 15 years old. I was just happy to have someone to share the adventure with that old wow used to be. Well he didnt get on the next day and never would again. To this day he is still on my friends list. It wouldnt be till a few years later thinking back about him that the weight of the implication of him never logging on again hit me. I hope he just had a life changing moment after he kicked it and just stopped playing wow. 

So wherever you are Yujanda, Jendras the orc remembers you."	pos

"The biggest argument Ive ever heard against a Superman game (other than Superman 64) is that it wouldnt be possible to make a game where you play as Superman, because nobody wants yet another Superman origin story and hes just too OP. I think I know a way to make it work though, hear me out.

There was an OG animated Superman cartoon episode/few episodes (I think mid 90s) where lex luthor (or some evil guy) had put up some sort of sun filter to change the sun from yellow to red. Thus, Superman slowly started losing his powers, and couldnt figure out what was up. So, you start the game as full power Superman, going through the tutorial of all his insane powers, flying through rings with no time to waste, absolutely destroying mechanical baddies, maybe even a few of the big names, but all with relative ease. Then, cutscene of Clark/supes not feeling well, not sick like kryptonite, just weak. Then, he has an encounter where he flies in, gets his ass absolutely handed to him by the same bots he was easily able to destroy without a thought yesterday, and is barely able to fly away, battered and bruised. The player then takes back control as a de-powered Superman laying low on the outskirts of the city who needs to destroy this sun filter to get his powers back. The map of metropolis shows a dozen different relays, all guarded by a different level of big baddie, with lex himself guarding the one in the center of the city. Each relay unlocks a different wavelength of light, that gives him a different power back (if you want to anger the purists, let the player choose/upgrade powers, or make that a new game+ mechanic where after the first playthrough you can choose a different version of Superman and get crazy different powers), so as he frees the city from the outside in, hes also getting stronger, but so are the enemies. As you destroy relays and defeat bosses, your notoriety raises and lex sends out hit squads to find and kill you, and they get progressively harder. Of course, the eventual boss has to include some sort of super serum lex luthor and/or kryptonite weapon, but by then Superman can throw things to break the kryptonite crystals and/or dodge with his super speed and laser from afar with his heat vision.


Edit: didnt like not knowing the episode I was referencing, because I think about it maybe twice a week, so I managed to track it down. Superman: the animated series- solar powered. Also, I am not going to correct it above, but the enemy was not lex but a scientist that used satellites to diffuse the suns rays, it wasnt an actual shield or blocker."	neg

"Maybe the health bar is public opinion. Each mission ends with a Daily Planet article. Less death and damage restores opinion, but more drops it. Civilians react based on the level to help and cheer, or shoot at you and make it hard to figure out who the real bad guys are. If it drops too low or you just randomly go on a rampage, then Batman/Justice League shows up with kryptonite weapons to put you down. Save Martha, is the cheat code to reset it.

Maybe it is unavoidable as you move through the game and the final boss involves JLA attacking you while you also try to fight the villain.

Maybe something similar with secret identity with missions as Clark. Enough people figure it out and Lois get killed."	neg

Oh yeah, one other thing real quick. Contrary to the popular argument used against us, no one is asking for another top down isometric style sprite based game (though I really miss those days :)). We understand that a sequal should evolve the game, but it needs to stay true to the game. An action RPG with Fallout 3 in the title is not Fallout 3. If you're going to evolve the game, do it the right way, don't rip off the mechanics of one of your own games (Oblivion) and then toss in some tripe like the VATS system and call it a game that evolves the series while staying true to its core."	pos

"OP posts a snippy little simple skit, the comments nod approvingly and everyone goes on their merry way. The cycle continues.

Frankly, this sort of dialogue seems terminally incapable of dragging itself out of the shallow grave it was born into. Its like a three headed hydra talking out of five sides of its mouth. 

Gamers arent a unified omniscient being. They are a class of consumers. Thats it.

As a class of consumers there is a degree of insulation between them, the Developer and the Publisher. Simply put, - **Consumers cannot spontaneously alter the working conditions for the internal structure of a company / industry without a strong focus point of knowledge and the ability to cooperate with employees from that industry**.

People talk about Game Difficulty, Intrusive Politicking and Sexy Costumes simply because **those are highly visible things which, as Consumers, they are knowledgeable of and can easily find information on**. The majority of entertainment media hammers this stuff constantly based on that exact idea. Though plenty bemoan it, its still a topic worthy of discussion even if the discourse itself descends into  a rubbish muck.

You need an actual focus point to harness the vocal power for industrial effect, and there are very few credible options to that effect available - its not like each game comes with an Ethically sourced sticker to judge by, nor is there seeming any effort to set such a process in motion.

Amazon Workers have had a boost via legal means precisely because their stories were widely disseminated alongside a remedy that was legally impactful. The Voice Actors guild got some middling takeaways during their 2017 dispute, but their gains were of course hampered by the fact that Developers were touted as being left behind by rewarding VAs more.

  

As consumers there are perhaps two ways of actually effecting anything - Money and Social Media. The trick is to present something that is **so viscerally, directly unavoidable that people are forced to recognise it as irrefutably bad while also presenting an actual feasible path to resolution**. Thats how players alleviated MK11s dreadful Microtransaction system, and how Battlefront II bounced back from being the biggest screwup of recent years.

As a general rule, Consumers are happy to wait if the product is good in the end (see: Assassins Creed), and put their faith in studios with good history (Cyberpunk 2020). Consumers are especially happy to invest under the promise of helping seasoned upstarts break off and through to the big leagues, though that has had difficult results (Shovel Knight, Mighty No.9, Phoenix Point, Fig).

"True Story: Apparently when I was a small child, no older than 4, my dad sat me down in front of the tv and had me play Super Monkey Ball. We would often play the minigames together, namely Monkey Race. My dad would beat me at the races every time. After about 3 months though, I started winning, and after 4 he just couldn't beat me. He apparently got so salty that he couldn't beat me that he just stopped playing against me and opted to watch. My mom said she had a good long laugh about that one."	pos

Blizzard achieved the highest revenue in history. Revenue. Not Profit. However, they expect this to drop by 13% within the next year because they are not producing enough games. To this extent they fired 800 non-developer personnel so they can hire more developers to make more games. You can bet the ""spirited"" reaction to their new mobile game factored into this downward revenue forecast.

Don't get your financial news from memes.

Edit: I cant believe my highest rated comment is defending Blizzard. If anyone who works there reads this, my apologies go out to anyone fired because the creator of the most popular MMO ever made decided to invest in mobile games.

"Now that I think about it, this might be a large part of why video game movies never translate correctly. Especially when it comes to horror.

The entire feel of a video game is based around video game parameters. It's made for things to be frightening or sad or exciting based on your interaction with them, not your passive observation of them.

So when they try to translate that to a movie, they end up sacrificing everything that made the game feel like it did just by way of trying to turn it into a passive artistic medium. 

It's why I can happily watch somebody play Resident Evil 7, but I can't get past the first interaction with the mom character. And why the movies are not even remotely scary."	pos

I was playing Rockband drums when I was a teen, and got angry because I kept screwing up a part that was keeping me from having a world record for a song.

The sheer shock of doing that has apparently prevented it from ever happening again.

Edit: It was actually Guitar Hero, not Rockband. The song was King Nothing. If anyone knows how to check the official scoreboards, I'd love to know if my record still stands, because I did get it eventually.

"Same with Crash N sane Trilogy, just superior to 3d-all stars. the Mario games in these collections are great, but this was lazy IMO, for Mario 64 they could've at least give it a 16:9 aspect ratio and not give 3D all stars a limited release, what the fuck is the reason for a limited release?"	neg
"You can literally download and play these games on a low end to mid range pc in under 10 minutes, and play with uncapped resolution and any aspect ratio"	pos
"From someone with a passing interest in speedrunning, I'm more worried the Switch version will be a port of the Japan-exclusive Shindou Edition.

So the Shindou Edition made a couple of changes, including replacing the infamous ""so long gay Bowser"" line and replacing it with ""buh-bye"" and patching the backwards long jump exploit that's popular in most speedruns.

BLJs are how players are able to beat SM64 with fewer than 70 stars by clipping through doors and skipping the endless staircase because the developers forgot to cap Mario's backwards momentum. It is possible to do these skips via a different method in the Shindou version but it requires thousands of frame perfect wall jumps to increase Mario's forward speed that have to be executed with perfect thirtieths of a second timing. Thus they are deemed TAS only because humans cannot reasonably execute this."	pos
"I never had consoles as a kid cause my parents were anti-video games, so you bet my ass I'm gonna buy the package that lets me play 3 of the most beloved video games of all time. This isn't really meant for the long-time fans of the series imo, this is meant to give newer fans the opportunity to play these games."	pos
"No.

First of all, *Spyro Reignited* is not a remaster, it's a remake. If Nintendo wanted those games to look modern, they would. See *Link's Awakening* and *Pokemon Let's Go Eevee/Pikachu.*

Second, the reason it costs 60 bucks is because it's Mario, the most recognizable game character of all. If Spyro had the same popularity, you can bet Sony would be pricing the game accordingly. 

And before I hear ""Nintendo fanboy"", let me tell you, I won't buy this collection without a discount, and do not like it being a limited product just to drive up sales."	neg

"Unpopular-ish opinion: Some people take reading a bit far as well but the core of the reason that I don't think games will be romanticized is because they can activite addiction centers in the brain that make you a less successful person. They also primarily engage physical reaction based parts of the basal brain. On the other hand reading generally makes you a more intelligent person, even if its a fantasy or sci-fi novel due to stimulating language centers. Drawing these comparisons as someone that was previously severely addicted to games and also created/ran a book club."	pos
"As much as this is true for open world and story based games grinding endless hours of league of legends or call of duty becomes unproductive. It can be helpful escapism during times of high stress but it just isn't the same as reading a book.

I imagine this would be a cool mechanic to have in a modern stealth based game."	pos
"I was born in 88, and my dad was a pioneer on the computer frontier so naturally I grew up intimately familiar with everything from the TRS80 to the Amiga500. When PCs and Windows 3.1 took off I remember the old resolution settings screen and the options for colors growing from 32 colors to 16 bit to 32 bit over the years into Win95. At that point, technology on color depth just stopped because the human eye is near incapable of perceiving more than the billion+ color combinations. We reached capacity.

I wonder if we'll get there with ray tracing or other graphical tech. Like, on this clip, I don't think I would ever notice if the NPC's eyes reflected my character (though maybe it's a small detail that your brain subconsciously picks up on that minimizes the 'uncanny valley' feel, I dunno). Is there going to be a point where resources are better allocated to other aspects of gaming and animation than details nearly imperceptible to the audience? I know there's always room for progress, but will we get to the top-off to where our own bodies become the limiting factor rather than the capacity to create?

"I'm a gaming mom so thank you! I'm 40 and my son will be 18 in 2 weeks. I'm a single mom so finding any ways to connect with him and make the bond as strong as possible was always my main goal. When he was younger he didn't game too much except for Minecraft. I played more games than he did, but I set him up with a Steam account a few years back and we've had fun playing together. On Spring Break in 2015 we spent every day playing Saints Row 3. The last day of the break we stayed up as long as we could and I was so tempted to let us both take one more day off to just play a little more that night. He's moved on to consoles but I love watching him play sometimes. We still talk about games every day anyway. It's one of my favorite bonding experiences with him   

Okay, gilded? Dang. Whoever did this, you just made me cry. To receive gold on a comment where I'm talking about my favorite person in the world, on Mother's Day, means a lot to me. Two years ago my mother passed away - *on Mother's Day*. In her own bed in our home. Last year I cried for weeks leading up to Mother's Day, to the point where I took a leave of absence from work and skipped an important final (I was in college last year). I thought I'd never be able to face Mother's Day again for the rest of my life. I've been a mess this month, I've had a cold all week, I'm going through a personal hard time right now, but this year I didn't feel as destroyed as last year. To get to be proud of my relationship with my kid on Mother's Day and have a bunch of strangers doing something so simple as upvoting the comment, and someone being so kind as to gild it? Tears. You got me today, Reddit <3

"There are so many things wrong with the male fantasy is all games are about argument.

First, Its a renaissance of strong female characters and that movement began way before the Sarkesians of the world launched their crusades. I get wanting to tone down the secondary sex characteristics in video game women, flipping around in melee combat or running through a hail of gunfire with size GG breasts is goofy, but do they want these women in peak physical condition to be sexless? If so, every Olympic village would like a word with you.

Second, male body dysmorphia is on the rise hardcore because of our fiction. The Marvel body is now the standard for a good looking guy, have it or  be relegated to second string. The depiction of Kratos or Captain America isnt doing anything to empower or enable a male fantasy.

Third, wanting to feel powerful isnt exclusive to men and it is so damn stupid to say it is. Who doesnt want to leap tall buildings in a single bound and be more powerful than a locomotive? My gf made the comment recently about wishing she was able to walk alone at night through our neighborhood, she wished she had the power to take down a potential attacker with superhuman ease. Needless to say I reprimanded her for wanting to live a male power fantasy and sent her back to the kitchen where women belong! /s obviously

Its a dumb notion that video games are just for male power fantasies. People that arent strong enough to go after real issues attack fiction and try to play politics with that which should be apolitical unless the narrative is one meant to evoke political messages."	pos

Give a company like CDPR a few extra months to polish their product, and it will be worth the wait. Especially with the past couple of years having shown that developers are more than willing to shove out a half finished product with the promise of ""patching it later"", it's refreshing to see some of these developers lately announcing delays to take the time necessary to actually finish and polish their games before release. Thank you CDPR, for having respect for your players, and the integrity to actually put the proper care into making your product the best it can be."	pos

"Id argue that the DualShock 4 was a big improvement on DS3, its a much nicer controller to hold as the grips are a better shape and its slightly bigger.
Edit: a word"	pos
"And none of those is really superior.

The Dual Shock is really a great controller and on the top of the list for many people. I doubt there are many who would say its a bad controller. And let give credit where credit is due. They came up (as far as major OEM goes) with the dual stick paradigm which is now key to playing FPS on a console!

MS made some great controllers during the years and IMO they have come up with the best layout and button placement (and spacing) of all major OEM. And as the picture says, they really are taking a look at what was critizesed each generation and try to improve it. The 360 pad was fantastic besides the terrible D-Pad and some stick deadzone after some play time and the XBone pad now has IMO the best D-Pad I ever used (I mostly play platformers with it) as well as sticks with not deadzone even after months of play time. Its easily my most favorite pad of all time.

Nintendo on the other hand as truly moved the industry forward like no other when it comes to controls. Be it the D-Pad, analog thumbsticks, shoulder buttons, vibration, motion controls or split designs, they came up with it all (as far as major OEM go)! That being said, I would say that a lot of there products don't stand the test of time, especially the three pictured pads. The 64 pad feels really arkward to hold, as you either choose the stick or the D-Pad because you can't really handle both at the time, misses the extra two shoulder buttons and the yellow action buttons are strangely arranged for a modern gamer. At least the last criticism is also true for the Game Cube pad, along with the weird sized right thumb stick. The Wiimote together with the Nunchuck is actually really comfortable because of its split nature, but for modern games it just lacks a second thumbstick as well as more easy to use buttons. The SNES controller is an all time great but a fair bit to small for my taste. The NES controller is just uncomfortable, sorry fanboys. Same goes IMO to the default Switch pads when deatached from the console, along with the missing real D-Pad (WTF) and the weird button spacing. "	pos

"Reminds of when I was 13 playing the first fable game. I was in my characters house, just shooting objects to test out my new bow I just got. Suddenly, my character's wife walks in the room from behind me, and my aim auto snaps to her head.

I panic and shoot her, taking her head clean off. I was horrified but also laughing. My little brother was watching me play, and promptly ran to his mom to tell her I murdered my wife in the game.

I wasn't very far into the game, but I was still farther than I had ever got before.      

I ran into a non hostile (maybe even friendly?) NPC.   
We chatted and when it seemed he was out of scripts to follow I started to move on...
Then I thought he looked like he was geared out better than me... Time for an upgrade. 
I attacked.... He is not amused. Nor is he hurt in any meaningful way. He gets medieval on my ass.   
I ran. He chased. It went on for a while... 
Eventually he caught and killed me.    
Lesson learned.

It's been more of a stumbling block than learning to code from scratch, honestly.

We got a Jack Russell Terrier for my mom when I was 24. She had ALWAYS wanted one. Named her Jynx.

Well, Jynx was high spirited, high energy, and high anxiety, and over time, she bonded very strongly with my Dad. He loved that Dog, no matter what he said. Gave her milk, hot dogs and other little treats when he thought we werent watching. 

Dad died back in 2013. Jynx was getting on in years by then, and when he died, that dog was totally lost. She would walk the house constantly...just searching for him. She died last year. 

This post made me smile to think about how special their bond was."	pos
"One of the only times I ever saw my dad cry was when our GSD died. We were country fuckers so my parents had enough land to bury their pets. She came home from the vet in what looked like a super thick trash bag. 

I was around 10, old enough to help with this kind of work. She was about the same age so we must have had her almost my entire life. We took her down the hill into a clearing in the woods and dug the hole. When we were finished he had me say my goodbyes and insisted I leave so he could say his. He was totally straight faced the entire time, at the vet too, but I secretly suspected he was holding back at least a few tears.

I got like two minutes up the hill when I heard this mournful wail from the woods. Almost a yell. After another five he emerged shirtless and red-faced. He said he tore the bag open so he could see her one last time and she wouldn't be trapped inside it forever. Then he felt weird about covering her face with dirt, so he carefully wrapped her in his shirt. She was a good dog, as they all are."	neg

"We had a dog for 15 years. My dad would always call him a 'mutt', 'stupid dog', and generally just not act very lovingly towards the pup. But I knew he loved that dog. He always fed him. Let him outside for potty. Gave him food scraps. 

Now, I've only ever seen my dad cry once, maybe twice before. One time he tore a ligament in his thumb playing street hockey with us, the other maybe at a funeral one time. 

We put our dog down at 15 years. Originally, my dad casually said he wasn't going to be there with my sister and me. The day of, he was blowing us up, telling us to wait for him to get there. A few days after we put Bailey down, our neighbor came by with a picture(they are professional photographers) one of them took of Bailey looking out our house window. It was the best picture ever taken of our dog. When my dad opened the door to accept the gift, he broke down into tears like I've never seen.

He fucking loved that dog. Was a very good boy."	pos

"First up, there is enough media that everything hits something that happened in the real world. A game mentioned an attack on the World Trade Center just before it happened, for example.

Secondly, this purposely neglects to mention that there are also nanosuit supersoldiers, open military actions against North Korea, *AND ALIENS*... so yeah, good job cherry-picking.

Thirdly, I don't think it's even remotely close to a World War. Wasn't it only the USA against NK? No other country involved? If you're counting that then we're up to World War 57 or something by this point.

Fourthly, the virus stuff is in the sequel which takes place in 2023, not 2020.

Please, people, for the love of god, anytime someone goes ""LOOK AT THIS COINCIDENCE,"" look it up to confirm it. It's so easy for someone to just throw out some facts about a game you haven't played and make you assume that they're right about it."	neg

I always build them up so much in my head, they can't possibly live up to my expectations, and I just end up disappointed.

That people hang onto our every word. 
That they care what we think. The truth is, you should consider yourself lucky if it even occasionally get to make someone, anyone, feel a little better.
After that, it's all about the people that you let into your life...

... of lost loves... ^(You never called) ^...  ^^I ^^miss ^^you.

... even those who've left us. ^(There you are!) ^... ^^Hi, ^^tiger!

    Take care, brah!  .... Take real good care...        Boing-flip!

    I didn't kill her.                                              Way to leave a cheery gig, bro. BYKHAAAH!

    Keg party later, there'll be prostitutes.           Hooch is crazy.

    Did you ever go on that picnic? Make sure you do.

And even though it felt warm, and safe, I knew it had to end. It's never good to live in the past too long. As for the future, thanks to Dan, it didn't seem so scary anymore.  It could be whatever I want it to be.

"It makes perfect sense tbh. Go look up stats regarding sales by franchise. Mario is legit untouchable; he's a titan at the top and no one else even comes close. To give you an idea, Pokemon typically ranks #2 or #3 (see different sources regarding it vs. Sonic) as best selling franchise *of all time* and clocks in at about 300 million copies sold. Mario is DOUBLE this at 675 million. You legit cannot touch Mario. You'd somehow need to be able to trade Pokemon, Sonic AND something else just for Mario just to make it a fair trade. Nintendo already has all of those, so creating a fair trade to get access to Mario is basically impossible.

Microsoft legit cannot possibly offer something worthy enough to warrant a Mario trade. Sucks for Microsoft, but they just don't have the franchises to reasonably trade with Nintendo. If they were smart they'd just aim low and go for anything they could ""afford,"" regardless of if it's their most desired franchise. Start by getting a trade for someone more modest like Kirby, then build off that hype of fans thinking all Nintendo titles will eventually come over to climb the ladder and get as many as you can."	pos

Nintendo did add their own after awhile, but it's hardly mandatory and costs pennies compared to XBL or Sony's network.  If this alters their ecosystem such that XBL eventually becomes near mandatory it's gonna wreck Switch for a good portion of the market."	pos

"To be fair, Mario is developed by Nintendo themselves while Minecraft and Cuphead are by other developers, Microsoft dies have the rights to them. There's also the fact that the Xbox One has a lot more AAA titles and more accessible support. I would say it's a bit fair but I feel like I would strain the word of what it's worth by using it."	pos
I remember for my one birthday when I was younger my dad took me to a local game shop to purchase game time to play N64. This game was the game I played with my Dad for almost an hour. He has never liked video games but me and him played that game together. Will never forget that. 	pos

"When me and this one girl broke up and I was in a pretty bad place in my life, I drowned my sorrows in Fallout: NV. Now, ten years later, married, children, gone through college... I legit still have a hard time playing that game.

Sucks because it is my favorite all time game."	neg

I think I wouldn't have been able to cope with that loss without that game.

"Gaming industry worker here. Not defending some blatant examples of ""you've carried it too far buddy"", but you also have to understand that games 15 years ago and games now have litteraly nothing in common in terms of development, scale, and teams working on them. AAA games today pretty much NEED monetization of some sort to be viable, given the sheer amount of money and ressources they require to craft today.

Gamers expectations are growing every year, no one would accept a game looking or playing like Oblivion in 2021. If you're going to play a new AAA game every year, that is bigger, prettier, and hopefully better than the one from the year before, you have to accept that games will be monetized in some way, and at least SOME of the player will pay for extra content (and that need to be a decent percentage). Some monetization choices are juste better than others.

Otherwise it's going back to 2005 graphics and mechanics, and no one would accept that."	pos
"Expensive cosmetic microtransactions are really only accepted in free to play multiplayer games. You get the game for free after all. They need money to maintain the game and you sure as hell don't want it to be pay to win.

Horse armor for skyrim though? You paid usually $50 for the game and then they come along with 0.0000001% extra content that was probably half-developed and abandoned to save money, for 6% the price. It's not reasonable."	pos
"This is called Demand-side economics. In other words, the prices are what they are because that is the market price based on the customer demands."	neg
"Tbh this is taken a little out of context. There are many more games that use a free to play structure now so it makes sense for them to charge more for add ons since that's how they have to make their money. It's also important for the transactions to be cosmetic only otherwise its pay-to-win. Some games may be abusing the pricey cosmetic structure but I have no issue with free to play games doing this. 15 years ago you would've had to pay full price for games like Fortnite, Apex, Warzone, Destiny 2, etc."	pos

This is in Brazil, most likely in a store called Lojas Americanas.

Consoles in Brazil usually range from around 1.5 to 3.5 minimum wages, or more if it's on launch.

Games also usually range from 1.5/10 - 3/10 of minimum wage on launch, higher price being for AAA games. They become cheaper as times goes by, for example, after 2 years since launch you may be able to buy a game for 0.5/10 of minimum wage.

Brazilian minimum wage is 1,045.00 reais. Buying power is around 4 times less than American minimum wage.

Edit: I am talking about the monthly minimum wage. Sorry about not clarifying..."	pos

"Guerrilla Games are the absolute antitheses of EA. This game was never intended to have DLC - The base game was supposed to be more or less the finished article. No microtransactions, no bullshit, just a good fucking single-player game.

The game was *so* good that the fans *asked* for DLC. Perfect example of how DLC should be done. Not restricted base content that you have to pay extra for - added bonus content that you *want* to pay extra for.

The people also asked for an Ultra Hard difficulty and New Game+ mode (where you start the story again but keep all your equipment/resources/skills and can re-choose the difficulty), and Guerrilla obliged. For free. They talked with fans and took the time to develop content, free content, that EA would have wrapped into a $20 bundle. I love this game!

**Edit:** If you're wondering whether to buy Horizon - definitely do. Simply, it takes all the best bits of Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Skyrim and Fallout and puts them into one awesome game, whilst leaving behind the worse bits such as endless ""escort"" missions and radial or simply excessive side-quests. The combat is truly the best feature. Akin to Assassin's Creed crossed with Dark Souls, the combat really makes you feel like a pro once you've been playing a little while. It doesn't feel like a slugfest or grind; you come out of every fight with the satisfaction that you just took that bitch *down.*

I particularly like that it's not too deep. Skyrim for example can feel like an endless rabbit hole of sidequests and dungeons that, if you wanted to 100% complete, would take literal weeks or even months. If you want to binge-play Horizon to completion, you can complete a full playthrough *and* New Game+ playthrough in probably 2 weeks. There's enough content that it's rewarding, but they also achieved the perfect sweet spot where there's not too much to do.

One last praise, you can achieve the Platinum (100% completion) trophy without touching the DLC or even the New Game+/Ultra Hard update. Because Guerrilla made it that way, because they love you."	pos

"I know in my heart that this is a joke, but it reminds me that I am not a part of this current generation or even previous generation of gamers and makes me feel a little old (and 30's is not old, or so I tell myself) ... When I was a kid I was playing GTA 2 pressing the belch/fart button and laughing maniacly, shooting in all directions in top down perspective. When GTA made the jump to 3D in 3 my parents didn't want me playing such a controversially violent game and  instead let me play the likes of Duke Nukem 3D, Counter Strike, Perfect Dark, etc (don't judge them, they were both working adults barely scraping by raising four kids and didn't have time to screen all the content I or my siblings were into and made opinions from the news of the time). I only had the opportunity to watch or play GTA3 at friends' houses. It was funny that such a taboo game at the time got so popular. I lost much interest in the series after San Andreas and got very excited for GTA 4 when the ""Things will be different"" trailer. 

I played a little bit of GTA 5, but the magic is lost with age. It seemed like there was some regression in content, the focus on development for multiplayer over single player content and predatory micro transactions over the last few years reallly drove home that the humble singleplayer sandbox I used to love is no longer a game that I find any fun. Heck, as the popularity of gaming and the internet rose up, the sense of wonder and discovery in these open world sandbox games seems to have diminished somewhat. There were always tip magazines and gameFAQs, but the lunch table always had that one kid (His dad worked for Nintendo, after all) that made up blatant lies about games that you had to find out for yourself if they were true by playing to call him out on his shit rather than whipping out a phone and scrolling through a letsplay then and there to to prove him the fool.

I love gaming, and I will always have nostalgia for GTA. I just wish that we had a 6th by now that was less focused on mtx and cinematic elements and more focused on fun sandbox shenanigans."	pos

Activision Blizzard is a publicly owned company and its price per share is based on *future earnings growth.* Blizzard must grow revenue or its stock will crater.

Blizzard knows casual mobile is the future growth. People are getting poorer every year. Right now, the 8 richest people own more wealth than the bottom half of the entire planet. The trend is crystal clear.

"Brink was disappointing, but im going to come to the defense of the developer splash damage.  They started with a mod for return to castle wolfenstein called enemy territory.  Unlike other games attempting something similar, with its distinct classes and clearly defined objectives.  I was hooked.  Then their follow up was quake wars enemy territory.  The gameplay of et in the world of quake with vehicles and huge open environments.  A great game as well.

Then brink came out.  I was excited and happy for the devs, but there were lots of issues with the game.  A disappointment and a set back for sd.

Their followup is dirty bomb.  Back to  true form.  A great game that encourages team play that expands upon their class based system.  For example, there are 5 different medic classes.  Just a great variety of distinct classes, with probably the best shooting ive ever played in a fps.

It is free to play.  More should try it.  Ill be sad if one day they devs abandon their game design model of class based focused obj teamplay.

"Personal anecdote:  I've never played Elden Ring - but I was HARD into Destiny 1.  To the point where I'd log in just to join groups that were raiding for the first time - not as a sherpa, just as an extra group member that was familiar with the raid, just to help things go smoothly.  
  
On the old LFG, I'd look for Sherpas making a group of newbies to take on the Vault of Glass - and if they had enough rookies, I'd back out and find another group, I just enjoyed playing that much.  I ended up joining a group with a very experienced player - and if you're not familiar with Destiny, the lore is interesting, but not terribly important to play the game;  it (sometimes cryptically) reveals motivations for characters, backstories - it's all very interesting, but not required reading to play.  
  
This Sherpa acted more like a tour guide, talking about the history of the vault, what's happening and why we're here.  He'd stop the raid group at certain 'safe spots', where he'd pause to talk for a while, and answer any questions.  
  
It was probably the most interesting experience I'd ever had in a video game."	pos

"A good buddy and I played FFXI for four years together on an almost daily basis. We were high school students at the same time, granted he was a grade above me, and his home life was horrible. 

We celebrated his high school graduation online, talked via email about the game and other life shit, and planned to meet up IRL when we were both 18 and on our own. You gotta understand this is someone who sent messages to me every day while I was hospitalized for attempted suicide - like the warmest and most loving things an online friend could send in a very dark time of my life. Coming home to read them was a genuine highlight of my young life. 

This wonderful, kind online friend from Michigan was also self-medicating to cope with the emotional (and I suspect physical) abuse he suffered at home. 

Reading his obituary was so rough because the love he gave to people online I dont think he ever got at home. 

RIP Mal - I wish you got an ounce of the kindness you showed everyone else online. I still think about you over a decade later, my dude."	pos

We were in our early to mid thirties and she was a senior in high school, but we all shared a lot of interests and over time we grew to be really close with her. She was like a little sister to us. We were really proud when she joined the army and cried with her when she miscarried shortly after her 21st birthday, supported her through the end of her marriage and partook in the joys of her finding herself again and rebuilding her life.

Then for reasons unknown (though we have some inkling), one night she left her apartment after her boyfriend left for work, went to the nearby field, and shot herself in the head. It's been a few years now and it still hurts to think about. Miss you, Rissa."	pos

His boyfriend, a day or two later, took his own life and was found dead at home. They're both still on my friends list, still in our group chats. Knowing I'll never see them pop online again, never get to hit them up for a quick game of Smash or Jackbox, never get to just vent about how my day sucked, it really stings. few months into all of us and our buds gaming together, we would always end every game session with ""Love you X, Love you Y, Love you Z"", listing off everyone's name, and at first they both thought it was funny, but they started saying it back without laughing and you could tell we all really meant it. You could say we were ""just gaming friends"", but it went beyond that, we were all a support system for each other, we all loved each other and said it and meant it.   


when a friend dies, I never delete them from my phone or friend list, sometimes I still send them messages. A friend of mine died before I met my wife, and I'd ""give him updates"" every once in a while on how I was doing, tell him about this wonderful woman I just had a first date with, how this girl told me she loved me, how I was going to propose to this girl, how this girl said yes, how the wedding went, how I got a great job and I wouldn't have ended up with the amazing job with the amazing wife with the amazing life I have if it hadn't been for his influence.   


Shit fucking hurts, guys, but it hurts a lot less without regrets. If you value someone and the time you've spent with them, online or IRL, be it for a few matches or years and years of gaming, let them know. We are all gonna die someday and you'll have fewer regrets when you or someone else does if you at least give them that knowledge that you cared, you enjoyed them, and they mean something to you."	pos

"They wouldn't do this if people wouldn't pay it. Everything is 50-70 quid now, and people keep snapping it up, along with pre-orders, day one console prices, battlepasses + tiny DLCs, etc. If people stopped throwing money, companies would bend, because they would have to, to continue making money. Or they'd get more and more predatory, and collapse completely. I really, really wanted a Switch - still do - but they're so expensive, as are the controllers, and the games. And they've barely dropped in price. I don't mind paying more for quality, but I'm not gonna get 60 quids worth of enjoyment out of most of these games realistically.

You could go on quests to do things like rescue princesses from towers, kill ghouls, or bring back the holy grail. You could find magic spells that did stuff like turn on hidden magnets. The armor was super thematic too in that it protected you from losing a ball by blocking the side chutes or even put a post up between the flippers so balls couldn't shoot straight down the middle. 

And then there's the dragon. If you could stab it 3 times with the sword you got an opportunity to slay it. It would open its mouth and act as another ramp to shoot balls into. Successfully doing that a number of times unleashed an 8 ball frenzy. That's right, 8 balls at the same time. It was madness!! Man, I loved that game."	pos

We once had a puzzle--I think it was 25,000--that was titled ""Little Red Ridinghood's Hood"".  It was circular, and all one shade of red.  That's it, a big red circle of tiny little pieces.  And to make it worse, they figured out a way to have some (not many, but enough) of the pieces inside the puzzle have the same curvature as the edge. 

That was the hardest, and frankly the last, puzzle we did.  We finished it, glued it up like we did the others, and it hung in a place of pride among the others for years.  

OP, I feel your frustration.  It's now easily 40 years later, and I still remember that puzzle.

Is this supposed to be Chicago in the game or is it a fictional city? Is there any way to explore this place and appreciate the design without actually having to play GTA....?

Edit: upon closer look, I see mountains in the background so it cant be Chicago. Also what I thought looked like the historical Hilton Palmer House lacks the right details to be the Palmer House. But just to the left of it is a short building with the same top as The Four Seasons hotel in Chicago. Then there are some other buildings I cant name but theyre definitely based on buildings in Chicago.

This is beautiful to me! I work as a bike courier in downtown Chicago and see this all day. Currently on a long break out in a rural area and fascinated...

I vividly remember my older step brother getting this edition from my dads side of the family. I got a standard edition from my mom but it came with Too Human.	neg
"Ahhhh I remember getting this thing. Twas Christmas day, I was so excited I could finally play Halo online with my friends. Patiently waiting for everyone else to finish unwrapping their gifts so I can fly to my room and fire this puppy up. Texted the boys at like 6am letting them know daddy was on his way. Of course I get no response. Mom slowly unwrapps her last gift, making sure not to damage the wrapping paper that will never again be reused. The moment came, parents got up to start making food for the family soon to arrive. I run to my room with the resemblance of Chris Farley getting ahold of the shoes of Icarus. I get everything plugged in, pop in the disk and I'm met with a screen that would change my life for a solid 24 hours. ""Disk read error"". Rebooted, threw in a Gears of War disk. ""Disk read error"". I was mortified.

Thankfully I was working at Best Buy at the time and had the next day off. Showed up first thing in the morning the next day and swapped that shit for a regular old 360. I had already heard the stories of the RROD. Of course my manager had to catch me and give me the ol ""We could sure use your help today if you want some extra hours"". I respond by looking down and opening the bag to say ""Hope you had a great holiday!"" as I left the store to enjoy the new device that would provide years of enjoyment through Halo, Gears of War, and Splinter cell. God that was a great generation."	pos
"This was the best Christmas ever! 

I knew where my mom hide our presents before wrapping them. So, teenage me pulled the old switch a roo and put my original Xbox in the 360 box before she wrapped it.

I bought a friend's Sisters kid one of these for Christmas. His folks were poor as fuck I had a little extra cash. So this kid who thought he might score a board game and some clothes and got a 360.

We should form a small thread where we can list our names and all pledge to donate like five or so dollars each until we as a group reaches the 1200 dollar status and donate it as a lump sum.

"Hi everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster.

This reminds me of an experience I had playing Journey years ago on my PS3. I didn't have real internet and it was the only game I could play online via my phones crappy WiFi hot spot. To those not familiar with the game, it has an interesting seamless multiplayer system. As you travel across the desert you come across other players on a journey of their own. You can't see their online handle and there's no voice chat. All you get for communication is a sort of Morse Code pulse that you could hold for a big pulse or spam for smaller fast pulses. Another traveler and I crossed paths and began to head towards the light in the distance together. There's something special about communicating with another player without words. A bonding feeling I can't quite explain. About an hour into our shared journey, I got stuck outside the map behind a huge wall. Without hesitation, my new friend began pulsing all along the wall trying to locate me. There is a limited flight mechanic in the game but a pulse from another player can recharge your flight meter, allowing you to fly longer. My travelling companion spent near 2 hours pulsing back and forth, trying to help me fly high enough to get over the wall and back into the map. It was a long and frustrating process. I stepped away for a moment, deciding to just log off when I got back. I came back to see my friend still pulsing away even with no response from my end. They never left me. They could have just logged off and left me behind that wall but they didn't. That motivated me to keep trying. After countless attempts, I finally made it up and over the wall. As I floated back down into the map, my companion greeted me with a series of ecstatic pulsing which I happily returned. We danced in a circle, pulsing, displaying our joy. My travelling partner drew me a heart in the sand and I knew I had found a friend. After our moment of victory, we continued on to the next level. A few minutes into the level, my friend turned a corner and was gone when I followed. A moment later, I saw the ""Connection Lost"" message on my screen. My phone screen lit up. Someone had called me, interrupting my hot spot and disconnecting me from the game server. Just like that, my new friend was gone forever.

To my friend and travelling companion: Although I never learned your name or heard the sound of your voice, in those few hours you became one of my dearest friends. I'll never forget you."	pos
"Ah man good times - when I was like 13 met a dude, Water, playing SWG. He was a few years older but we games together for like 10 years. Met a buncha dudes along the way as well, formed a guild in WoW with the whole remnants of our SWG server (Tarq) and played with those guys for like another 6 years through various games. Few of the guys later on I still talk to. 

Its crazy to think that just picking a different server in SWG could have completely changed my path in life based on the people I interacted with and got advice from and talked to everyday. "	pos
"I'm the friend that vanished.

I was a Rogue in WoW, was leveling for the first time and some guy just started talking to me (whispered me in old Hillsbrad).

Told me tons of useful things about the game, helped me out heaps in Hillsbrad, and then he invited me to the guild he was in, hopped onto his Mage main and mailed me a whole set of Netherweave bags he tailored up himself.

I ended up moving to a different country for a few years a little later on and by the time I came back online, the guild either kicked me or had disbanded and I eventually popped off to an IRL friends server to continue playing my Rogue.

Cheers, Somnium. I'll have you know, those bags are still being used in my bank."	pos

"Halo shocked me in 2001 because of all the things it introduced to first person shooters that we now think of as commonplace. 

The first time I climbed into a warthog and started driving around my mind was blown. There was nothing like that in a video game. And I thought ""Man, this is pretty advanced""... *And then the Marines started talking to me, giving each other orders and following them, the enemies used flanking maneuvers against us, and then the Marines jumped into the warthog that I was driving and started opening fire on the advancing enemies*. (A true ""holy shit, this is special"" moment for me.) And it introduced so much that we take for granted today: AI teammates that aren't useless. Enemies that use their own tactics to respond to yours. Being limited to two weapons (does anybody else remember when your character in an FPS could carry around 20 guns 20,000 rounds of ammo and still run 30 mph?). Vehicles used for *actual* combat, and not for just traveling from A to point B and shooting enemies while the thing basically runs on rails. Control scheme that every first person shooter made in the last 19 years has copied. ""Multiplayer"" with 16 people by connecting the Xboxes to a LAN (pre online console gaming). *And a story*. Back in those days, a first person shooter was either really boring with an engaging story, or really fun with almost no story to even care about (with few exceptions). Halo combined exciting fast paced arcade style gameplay with an engaging and deep sci-fi mystery story. 

Edit: as others pointed out, other things like an adaptive soundtrack that followed the action in the game rather than sequenced events, regenerating shield/HP and so many more innovations. And since this took off I wanted to add my personal connection to Halo.

I wanted an Xbox so bad in 2001. All my friends were getting the PS2 because it had been out for a year and was a little less expensive and had a lot more games and we were all PlayStation gamers through the late '90s. My parents hated video games but knew that my brother and I loved them, so they never splurged or spoiled us in that department they were cool about it. 

On Christmas day 2001, my mom and dad surprised us with an Xbox, Oddworld: Munch's Oddyssey (Oddworld was my favorite game on PlayStation and the 3rd game was the reason I wanted an Xbox after being such a die hard PS gamer), and my dad surprised us with HALO: CE.

My brother and I played the game all night, we only got midway through the second level before we decided to start sniping each other with pistols. So we switched to multiplayer. One-on-one had never been so fun. 

**The next day** I was going to my best friend's house and I wanted to bring the Xbox. My brother protested but my mom let me because it was pretty much the only thing I got for Christmas even though my brother and I were sharing it (he was younger so he got some extra stuff, I was happy with us getting an Xbox). And I was at this friend's house literally 3 nights a week at least, basically my second home. A bunch of neighborhood kids came over we had a blast playing four player Halo in the same basement on the same TV that we all grew up playing four player GoldenEye. We packed it in and then hopped on a train to the movie theater to go see How High. *That was the last time I saw my Xbox.*

When we got back from the theater, his house had been broken into and the Xbox taken. None of the games were taken except Halo which was in the console. One of the controllers were left. His computer, his 100 disc CD changer and Yamaha stereo sitting right next to the door they broke into, his book of CDs, the television, the DVD VCR combo, their PS2 and it's games, none of the Christmas presents they just got, nothing else was touched. Just **my** Xbox taken from *someone else's* house the day after Christmas. And not just anyone, literally my best friend from preschool. My parents came running over, they called the police because that thing was not cheap, raised all kinds of hell. Started questioning all the kids who were there and went to the movie and especially wanted to talk to the ones who didn't come back with us. Of course nothing was ever figured out, the police closed it, and my younger brother, who begged me not to take it because he didn't want anything to happen to it, resented me. 

I spent the next few months saving money, literally anytime I saw change I would grab it off the ground, and if my mom gave me a few bucks to go to the movies with my friends I didn't buy any popcorn or drinks. When I got close I sold some stuff on eBay, and finally in May of 2002 I had saved up enough money to purchase a used Xbox and a used copy of Halo. 

All was forgiven when my brother and I booted up Halo, sat down, and played that for what felt like 10 hours straight until we finished what we started Christmas Day. And it's still my favorite game to this day. 

Side note: later on that year we found out one of the guys who was with us had a cell phone (2001- The only kids who had cell phones were drug dealers and rich kids and no one in my neighborhood was rich so...) and after we got to the movie theater he called his drug dealer buddy we went to school with who lived up the street and told him ""/u/sheepsleepdeep got an Xbox for Christmas and it's down at BBBBB's house where we always chill, go snatch it."" And he did. And they laughed about it and told our mutual friends they did it and there was nothing anyone could do because they were drug dealing violent assholes. And they both never stopped dealing drugs, and they never moved out of the neighborhood, never had kids, and they're dead now. "	pos

"I both hated and loved the day I got my PS1 for Christmas.

When I was 5, I got a Sega Genesis for Christmas, right after my parents got divorced. I got to play it 4 times over 2 months during custody and then my dad gives it to his fatass fiance. 

The next year my mom got my an SNES with Super Mario Kart, Super Mario World, Uniracers, Primal Rage, Earthworm Jim, Stunt Race FX, and Mortal Kombat 3.  Nobody ever took it from us and my mom let me and my friends play as much as we wanted.

A few years later my dad gets me an Estes rocket set. I didn't get to launch it for over a year.  They kept it locked up in their bedroom, because his fatass bitch wife(same woman) told him I'm too young to play with them, even though I'd been using them at school for Science class. 

So Christmas eve rolls around that year and my guinea pig Petey dies. My mom and stepdad are freaking out because my dad was supposed to pick me and my brother up that morning, and they didn't want us to be there while they buried him, since it was turning out to be a pretty shitty day already.  Well, he finally got there at 4 in the afternoon.  We sat there and just waited for the weekend to be over, since we knew it would be shitty.  I got slapped for crying because my pet had died.  So I spent the rest of the night in my room.

Christmas morning.  Her kids got woken up early, and me and my brother were so exhauseted from the day before that we slept until like 10 am.  Her kids were playing a PS1.  We got so excited and asked if we could get a turn.  Well, apparently it was for ALL of the kids at first, but Tina, my stepmom, decided that since we woke up late, we didn't deserve it, so she let her kids keep it. 

I went and called my mom, asked her to come get us, and she did.  We explained what happened.  So my saint of a mother comes in along with my stepdad, they grab all of our stuff, even stuff that we owned before this, and takes it to the car.  My stepdad gets my dad to go into pussy mode, and has him get the rocket set.  Turns out, my dad let my older brother Nick use it, he just lied about it the entire year and even though he made $37 an hours, couldn't buy me a new one.  

So my mom walks over, rips the PS1 from the tv stand, and throws it against a wall as hard as she can.  The thing shatters, and my step mom's kids start freaking out.  We leave, we get some McDonald's, which at our age was just perfect, get home, and guess what's waiting for us.  A PS1, and a rocket set.  The first day the snow disappeared, we launched every rocket together at the park.  

Best part?  I didn't have to see my dad for 2 years, then 2 years later I was able to decide if I never got to see him again.  I did get to see him, only to have my mom serve him the papers.

I want to add something.  I know people will get mad at my mom for breaking the PS1.  But, from the time I was 4, to the time I was 9, my dad skipped out on child support. Took 5 years to get his wages garnished.  During that time, every dollar that me and my brother got for birthday and Christmas, my stepmom kept for herself.  So it was completely justified.  When I was 22, my mom died.  At the funeral my step mom said we deserved it.  I shattered her nose.  Fuck bullies. "	neg
"I think it was the most excited I have ever been when I went to sleep Christmas Eve 1997, literally could not sleep a wink. About 4am I begged my Dad to get up with me and open my main present.

Great times... holy fuck that's 20 years ago this year."	pos
"Still my favourite console !
But that time I came home from my grandmothers for the weekend and finding my parents playing SNES that they bought for ya kids was the best surprise!

Watching my mom jump whenever Mario did still makes me laugh"	pos
I remember the Christmas I woke up and had this and Crash Bandicoot. Me and my mom played nonstop.. I will always cherish that moment for the rest of my life. My mom passed away three years ago at the age of fifty three. She succumbed to breast cancer she was fighting for years. This reminded me of her. Thank you for that OP. 	neg
"Funny PlayStation story for me. My parents bought my two brothers and I a PS1 for Christmas. Only had the demo disc for a few days and we loved it. 

But, as the PlayStation did, the laser eye got worn out and stopped playing games quite often. My oldest brother (not one of the original three who got the gift) was out of the house and had a job. He always gave us a hard time for playing video games too much. 

So a few years later for Christmas we were at my dad's and he grabs our PS1 and starts shouting about how much it corrupted our minds and made us lazy. He then pulls out a hammer and smashes it. I was in shock as my two other brothers start yelling and freaking out. 

As we mourned our first PS1 that barely played games, our oldest brother walks out of the bedroom with a brand new one. It was all a show and we had a good laugh and played more video games. "	pos
After I went to my buddies (who had a PLayStation) I decided that was the only thing I wanted. This was repeated by me and my brother about 300 times. When Christmas rolled around we each unwrapped a couple of presents...no PlayStation. I accepted defeat and decided that being upset would make me a real fuckboi. Once all hope was abandoned my dad pulled one last gift from behind the couch. Best Christmas of my life.	pos
"We got a Playstation for Christmas one year.  The console and cables, two controllers, a memory card, and a game or two.  Interesting part was that none of it was in boxes, except the games.  ~~Parents~~ Santa left everything on a folding snack table and put wrapping paper and a bow over them.

Later, my dad admitted it was from a floor display a friend had hooked him up with.  He had a friend who worked at a Toys R Us who would occasionally get him deals and stuff.  "	pos
"Cool picture!

I wish my parents were cool and bought me a console.  But, no, I got the try-hard hippies that thought TV rots your brain.  Now, they binge watch shit like Big Bang Theory and Buffy the Vampire Slayer and try to talk to me about it.  HOW IT THAT DIFFERENT MOM AND DAD"	neg
"I remember getting a PS2 on christmas.

The three of us kids (myself, a brother, and a sister) had a flashlight and stared at this big box under the tree from the stairwell. We were so excited to see what it was, but our dad heard us and said to go back to sleep seeing as it was 4 a.m.

A couple of hours of little sleep later we initiate our tradition of grabbing our stockings and unpacking them in our rooms. And then another hour later we go down for the presents. Of course our parents make sure the big present is last. All three of us get to open it and we all have this moment of ""oh my god it is a PS2!""

That was a good christmas for sure. The PS2 came with Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, Harry Potter Quiditch World Cup, ATV Offroad Fury 2, and Jampack Vol 11. We all have the fondest memories of those games. Jak and Daxter is still one of my all-time favorites, ROTK is still one of my favorite hack-and-slash, ATV 2 is still awesome, Quiditch is still fun, and Jampack introduced me to horror games and Ghost in the Shell (terrible game, great movie).

We got the PS2 later than others for sure, but we had been playing the N64 in total blissful ignorance that there was a PS2. Back then I did not follow the industry, and I honestly think it allowed me to enjoy things more."	pos
Good times. I remember getting mine. I miss my mom 	pos
"Almost brought tears to my eyes. My dad worked so hard in 98. I got the psx, test drive 4, crash bandicoot, Madden 98, nfl gameday 98 and the best demo disc ever."	pos
"I got one for my thirteenth birthday, and it was the second best birthday of my life. Oh lucky number 13 :) 

Only birthday that beat it was 11. Diablo II. 

Bonus life fact if you're still reading: The only time in my life I ever played Keno I bet 11 13 and 27. All hit and I won 200 bucks :)

I remember when I was a kid my older brother was playing Resident Evil and had just gotten up to the flooded room with the shark in it..fuck that was amazing..but we had to go camping that weekend and mom and dad are screaming at us to get in the car and the memory card was full so we decided to leave it running for the whole weekend. Good times.	neg

"I'll be 50 in August, been a gamer since the mid-1970s. Arcade and Console. PC wasn't a thing yet. 

Multiplayer involved getting your buddies together on bikes to ride around to the different grocery stores and find out where the new machines were. During the console crash of the 80s, we didn't stop playing, we were just rocking Commodore 64s and Apple IIs. 

Now here's the sobering bit:

Once I had the heart attack after Thanksgiving, I pretty much stop playing. It's not that I didn't WANT to play, I had shit to do in Destiny. My kid got me RDR2 for Christmas.

I just didn't have the energy to play. I couldn't concentrate. I couldn't spend more than 10 minutes in game and I tried, man, I really tried. 

Open heart surgery in December. Congestive heart failure and A-Fib flutter in January. I just went in and had them shock my heart last week and now I'm finally feeling like I can play again... I'll let you know."	neg
"I noticed when I hit about 27 there was a noticeable plateau I hit while gaming, and shortly after my performance and enjoyment for gaming has been steadily going down.

Almost 30 now, there are few games that entertain me enough to put in the time, and even fewer I feel like I can even still compete in.

I actually explained this to my mom yesterday. Her response was an excited Oh so youre not gaming as much?! And I said No, Im still gaming the same but just not enjoying it."	pos

"Mid-30s here. Cannot relate at all. Y'all need better keyboards/posture/chairs.

Carpal tunnel: Use a keyboard with a wrist rest. Make sure the keyboard is lying flat (**not** propped up, which it is in the picture) on your desk. Make sure your wrists are relaxed and straight. Move your arms, not just your wrists, to reach distant keys.

Eye strain: If it happens only at night, use f.lux/Redshift/etc. If it happens all the time, turn down your screen's brightness/color temperature.

General confusion: Lots of things can cause this, like poor sleep, soul-sucking job, having kids, and so on. Unfortunately, most of these are not easily fixable...

Lumbar support: Get a better chair. I know they're expensive, but back surgery is even more expensive.

Not knowing what Fortnite is: That's probably a good thing. It's a game, and from what I've heard, it sucks balls."	pos
"They weren't even being cool about it, they started the trailer by playing basically the same ambient piano music while the main character stood in front of a mountain."	neg
"They showed so little about either it worries me. Everyone hopped on the whole ""it's breath of the wild but pokemon"" thing based ONLY on the artstyle. In terms of gameplay, based only on what they showed it would be less feature rich then pokemon red and blue.

Even the DP remakes they didn't show anything that should be exciting people. If anything people should be worried because they said they'll be extremely faithful, which makes me think that nothing is changed and you'll be paying full retail price for a DS game that came out in 2006."	pos

"Tbh I'm disappointed, and I didn't even expect anything"	neg
No idea why people are comparing this game to Breath of the Wild.  BotW had physics based emergent gameplay in a large 3D sandbox.  The only thing they seem to have in common is being 3D.  Is that significant in 2021?  I think it looks a lot more like Dragon Quest 8.	pos

At least the animations are different and they have a year still so maybe they'll make it awesome, which actually doubt when I look at Swsh"	pos
"I really hope these look better at release. Im already not planning to get Diamond and Pearl immediately because Im sure itll be $60 despite what it is and looking like it needs some improvements. Legends has me really interested, but I need to see a lot more. I want to be excited but this is game freak, not Nintendo.

"I didn't have the heart to tell me mom this about the GameCube she bought me for Christmas. I did tell her a couple weeks later and she was sympathetic and said she'd get around to it. Well, it took another 3 months for that to happen.

She would come home to work a couple times each week and see me playing OoT on it and see me only ever get back to Dodongo's Cavern before having to turn it off for the night. It just took 3 months for her to notice that it took me a whole day to get back.

""Spinto, didn't you tell me you made it to that place yesterday?"" 

""Yeah, but I have to make my way back because I can't save the game. I start over every day so I know if I'll ever beat it.""

I was pretty nonchalant about it behind I think threw her off because she just stared at me baffled and told me we were going to EB games to get a memory card.

She was much more responsive to my habit after that."	pos
"I actually had a friend who got a playstation 2 for Christmas when we were kids they got him the playstation one game but no memory card.

"My parents legit did this with a Nintendo 3DS, they got the thing for me with no games (only wanted pokemon but even an old game was fine, it's a damn gift!). I told them that I couldn't really use it but that I loved it and asked for the one game I had asked for and they they thought came with it and I got told that I needed to be less greedy and that I should be grateful for even getting the machine. I mean, I was grateful but humbly asking for the one thing you need to use it doesn't seem like too much to ask after they bought the fucking device to use it. Needless to say, I waited for a year to get the game because the gift was already my bday and Christmas combined. Really fun times when your dad marries a woman who thinks her kids are saints and deserve everything and his kids are literal scum beneath her feet. I was 14 at the time and by no means begged or even acted like I was upset or disgruntled, I knew that if I did I would just lose the ds, at least I could borrow games from friends that way. 

Thinking back it's totally possible that they felt bad and they didn't know how to handle it, they aren't the best at managing their emtions and I try my best to be understanding. We are all only human."	neg
"So relatable. Got my first job. Bought a ps2 and Gran Turismo 3. Mom wouldnt let me own a tv so I had to use the family tv (still dont know why)  I Was a few bucks short for a memory card so I didnt get one. After day 12 of The ps2 being powered on in plain sight mom asks me what part I needed so I can turn it off. I explained the memory card was needed. She said get in the car, well get one. I was like I get paid in two days so well have to wait until then. She Straight up bough the card and said to repay in two days. I was shocked. I went home and saved my game and moved the console to my room. A year later, I bought my own tv and put it in my room without any protest. Killed two birds with one stone."	pos
My mom got me a halo 3 edition 360 with no games. This was early xbox live to so youtube wasnt a thing yet either. I got called ungrateful when i asked for a game. And some time later when she told me she got it for me just for me not to use it. I feel this	neg
And then Mom would turn it off and scold me for wasting electricity.	neg
"I remember when I first got my PS1, I was happy since I only had Street Fighter Alpha and Wipeout to play for a couple months, so I never really thought I needed to save anything. I finally found out just how important a memory card was when I realized I couldn't save in the first RPG I ever bought for the system: Beyond the Beyond. (The really good RPGs hadn't come out yet till Wild Arms and FF7 half a year later.  I was on a JRPG kick, and had to play anything in that genre, even mediocre ones.)  I had to save my allowance to finally buy a memory card, so imagine a whole month and half of playing through only the first couple bosses before having to turn off the system. 

With this, I found out one of the two major disadvantages of playing a CD-based console the hard way after years of playing cartridge-based systems.  The other disadvantage is long load times, just so you know."	pos

I barely played my dad's PS1 when I was a kid, I mostly played the 64 he got me. When the PS2 came out, neither I nor my dad knew you needed a freaking *PS1 memory card* to save PS1 games. And since my dad was aloof to the difference, year after year, half the games I got for Christmas would be PS1 games. I played those motherfuckers *just as much* as the PS2 ones. Deadass.  You have any idea what it's like to shutoff Final Fantasy VII after playing it for 18 hours straight, knowing your shit is wiped as soon as you touch that button?You have any idea what it's like to *start*  Final Fantasy VII, already *knowing* that after playing it for 18 hours straight, your shit would be wiped as soon as you touch that button? *Deep sigh*

My mom went out in that storm to buy a memory card for me. Plugged it asap and saved the game. Seconds later power goes out."	pos
It was such a scam. Official ones were often x2 or x10 more expensive than knock offs which worked as well.  So much extra costs.	neg
"To all the people feeling this right now, I'm sorry.  
  
I was working electronics retail since before the PS2 launch. Every time a parent came to buy a disc-based console for Christmas I would explain about needing a memory card. You know what those parents said? ""Oh no, that's too much money. I'll have [their aunt / uncle / grandparent] buy it or they can use their Christmas money."" Yeah. A $14 accessory was too much on a $200+ console. I tried guys. I really did.

got back home on like the 2nd of jan and sure enough there were presents under the tree. started opening, got most of the stuff i wanted, a bunch of stuff i hadnt asked for but it was still fuckin cool af. there was 1 particular thing, a pair of gameboy games, that i didnt see. no big deal, still a good haul and i figured santa or my parents just didnt want me playing video games since that seemed to be a theme.

opened one of the boxes of a toy and 2 more tiny little presents fell out. it was the games. i LOST. MY. SHIT. like TOTAL fuckin bonus round, it was insane.

another christmas i asked for a razor scooter. reasonably fast/easy transport was a biggy for me around that time and i didnt always want to ride a bike. i didnt get a razor scooter. instead, i got a Royce Union scooter. it had a VERY heavy duty frame and both front and rear suspension. i was sort of iffy about it but that fucker rode like a DREAM. i couldnt do tricks and shit on it due to the suspension but no big deal, i wasnt big on ""lets try stupid shit till i either get it right or get too badly hurt to continue"".

a few months later i tried out an actual razor scooter and found it was complete horse shit. every single place the sidewalk slabs were cut, ever single bump and rock and other debris, you felt ALL of it. the royce was smooth as butter. i fuckin LOVED that scooter.

As my two brothers got older they took jobs to help pay household bills. Life got a bit better but things we're always tight since they were still in high school and only working in the afternoons/evenings at minimum wage jobs. At Christmas a dream was a few hot wheels cars I could go out and play in the dirt with and I was extremely happy and grateful to get those. One Christmas I noticed the tree was bare except for one sizeable box for me. Come Christmas day I was given the box to open. It turns out my older brothers scrimped and saved and managed to buy me a Sega Genesis. It floored me then, and still amazes me to this day that they did that for me. I still have that Genesis and it still works. Part of me hates that the most emotional and memorable Christmas for me was the most expensive one, but it's more about the sacrifice they made than the money. "	pos

"I had a christmas like that when I was 11. Woke up early super excited for presents. I saw that Santa had taken a bite out of a cookie and drank half the milk, I knew I was gonna get that new skateboard this year. 

 I opened my presents with a fever that can only be expressed as an 11 year old on christmas morning. I opened the ones I thought could be a skateboard. First one was a bunch of notebooks for school. Second was some clothing my mom made me and the third was socks followed by a backpack and some other stuff that wasnt a skateboard.

I was devastated, I really wanted that skateboard. I had circled it in the CCS skateboard mail order book I had and left hints everywhere. I couldnt believe Santa(parents, I knew Santa was just them) had forsaken me, but I knew that money was tight so i just kept it to myself. 

My dad told me to go get some more firewood from the pile out back. I brought in am arm load and another. On the third trip I noticed a wrapped box in the wood pile. I grabbed it and brought it inside.

Dad goes ""looks like Santa dropped one.""

Still, happy moment. Taught me to never feel let down and that presents are fleeting but the moment will last. I bought a new board but I'll always remember that shitty spitfire board for the rest of my life. "	pos
"It was 2007. I was 10 years old and had never had a game console before, instead relying on my friends to get my video game fix. That year I decided enough was enough and I needed to have a game console for myself. I asked Santa (yes I still believed) for an Xbox 360. 

I lay awake in bed all night on Christmas Eve, the excitement never allowing me a wink of sleep. Every time I closed my eyes images of Grand Theft Auto flashed before my eyes. Soon enough I kept having to remind myself. 

Finally 7am came along, the time limit my mum set that we had to wait until before we started Christmas morning. My sister and I compared our Santa sacks (we're Australian, idk if everyone has this. It's a fabric bag all the presents from santa go in) and take turns removing presents and tearing off the wrapping paper. 

I grab present after present and it's not there. Finally I pull out a box that I think is big enough, but it's far too light to be the Xbox. Nevertheless I rip the paper off with the enthusiasm of a puppy with a new bone. I held in my hands a box for an Xbox.  Not believing it, I opened the box to see it with my own eyes. 

What greeted me instead was an empty box. I didn't know why Santa would do this, but I knew there must have been a reason. Without saying anything I closed the box, fighting back tears, wanting to get back to opening presents as quickly as possible so something would distract me from my despair. 

""What was in there?"" My mum asked

""Nothing"" I say, but I open the box to double check. I hadn't seen it the first time, but inside the box was a paper folded in half. I don't remember exactly what it said, but it was something along the lines of how good my sister and I had been that year, and that this present was partially mine, but a part of it was for my sister to be able to use too. It ended by saying to go downstairs to the guest bedroom. 

I was on my feet fast as lightning, running down the stairs as quickly as I could while my mom called after me to wait while she fumbled to get her camera ready. I opened the door and couldn't believe what I saw. They didn't just get me an Xbox, they got me a setup. There was a 50"" top of the line (at the time) flat screen TV mounted to the wall, two boom chairs, a small collection of games, and an Xbox 360 already plugged into the tv and ready to play. 

That 360 is still in my room to this day, though his modern day Sony cousin gets most of my attention now. I'll always keep it, even when it no longer works. And I'll always remember that morning. It was probably the best Christmas in my life. "	pos
I did this to my kid but it was the original Xbox. Just a single dad doing his best 	pos
"Ah I still remember when my dad gave me the PS2 on my birthday and I kept it up because I was so embarrassed that he would laugh at me but when I tried my first game, which was the Need for Speed Carbon, I was really excited :')"	pos
"Dad got me a N64, will never forget that Christmas. It was so unexpected, we didn't have much growing up. I just mentioned I liked it but never said I wanted it because I knew our financial position. Being aware of your financial position as a kid is tough. "	pos
">If I told you once, I told you a thousand times Mom & Dad. Get me the PS4 Pro....the God Damn **PRO**!! FML"	neg
"My wife at the time got me a Turkey baster. The $4 kind. I got her a bunch of awesome stuff. 

I left her a month ago after 8 years of hell and shit gifts ( tbh I didn't care about the gifts )"	neg
"I remember when I got my ps1.

My dad plugged in and I watched him play tekken 2 for 3 days."	pos

"Best part for Dark Souls was to see Caprademon jump to air with overhead attack, me rolling around it, and seeing it turn in mid air following my roll and then smashing it's swords at me. It was hilarious and felt cheap."	pos
"I thought all classes are balanced so I didn't bother with pew pew classes, because I like friction and penetration atracks. Based on the comments, I'm now realizing that I made my life much harder by having 40 str with next to no intelligence, mind or faith."	pos
Man I wish pop cap is still independent :(... Fuck EA	neg
"man, i remember the days of sitting in front of my childhood best friends dads computer together and playing this game for hours upon hours! such memories!"	pos

"I still remember when they announced PvZ2 mobile-exclusive and behind it was EA. I literally yelled ""FUUUCK!"" That day i knew Popcap, the one i knew and love, was dead AF"	neg
