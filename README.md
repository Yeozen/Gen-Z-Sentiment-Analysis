This is the code for the implementation of the 3 approaches in sentiment analysis of Gen Z speech. The three approaches are as follows:

1. Lexicon
2. Neural Network
3. Hybrid

The hybrid approach was hypothesized to have the best performance but disappointingly failed to do so. Neural network used was Cardiff NLP's BERT and it outperformed the proposed hybrid solution by 1% in accuracy. Dataset was hand collected but training set might be contaminated with garbage data as it was obtained using a scraping script.
Future improvements include a better training set and 'translating' Gen Z speech to more common vernacular for easier analysis by more readily available sentiment analysis tools.
